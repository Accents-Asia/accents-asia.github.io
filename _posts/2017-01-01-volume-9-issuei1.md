ABSTRACT

The shift from the industrial-age model of learning to one driven by the global knowledge economy has placed a burden on institutions of higher education to modernize teaching methodology. Although iterations of modern technology continue to mark their presence to varying degrees in learning environments globally, linking the instructional use of modern affordances with enhanced learning outcomes remains an issue. More than ever, research in effective integration points to professional development as the linchpin for success. This essay reviews the latest research and proposes ideas for adapting some of the best practices for professional development today at the individual and institutional levels. 

**Beyond a Transaction: Independent Vocabulary Study Approaches for English Conversation School Students in Japan**

ABSTRACT

Despite vocabulary size being widely recognized as a key predictor of L2 reading and listening proficiency, it could be argued that many students within English conversation schools in Japan (eikaiwa) are not given sufficient opportunities for theoretically principled vocabulary study. This paper analyzes existing research on independent study approaches as well as complementary classroom-based pedagogical practices that foster both incidental and deliberate vocabulary learning. Through the utilization of both mobile assisted language learning (MALL) and extensive reading (ER) programs, measured changes to a language course are suggested that could be feasibly implementable within the specific constraints of an eikaiwa setting. Furthermore, potential institutional, technical and affective obstacles that could hamper such a program's effectiveness are identified and discussed. This paper hopes to provide approaches to vocabulary instruction based on empirical data, while also remaining accessible to teachers in a context often overlooked in academic and pedagogical literature.

**Promoting Effort Attributions to EFL Students**

ABSTRACT

Attribution describes an explanation that learners provide for the progress of their second language learning and reasons they attribute to their success or failure in the process of learning a target language. This paper explicates three practical ways to promote effort attributions based in Dornyei’s (2001) motivational teaching framework to the learning process of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students. The explications are elaborated with relevant literature and my reflective learning experiences as a language learner in Indonesia. This paper will be an interest of EFL teachers who are looking for practical ways in enhancing motivation and academic achievements of their students. In essence, this paper encourages constructive collaboration between parents and EFL teachers in taking an active role to promote the effort attributions to students. 

**The Impact of Empathy on Attitudes Towards English in Japanese University Classes**

ABSTRACT

Data were collected from 192 Japanese university students relating to how they interpreted empathy and whether or not the presence of empathy was important in communicative English classes. Furthermore, to get a better understanding of students’ attitudes towards learning English, individuals were asked to give feedback about their studies at junior high school and high school. This was compared to how their attitudes towards English had changed after a year studying communicative English at university. The majority of students reported that it was important for empathy to be present in the learning environment and that their attitudes had changed positively over the course of a year. In addition, questionnaires were distributed relating to how teaching approaches, choice of tasks, and ways of interacting affected levels of empathy between classroom participants. The results from the data suggested that students enjoyed practicing communicating with strangers, enjoyed a range of tasks, and preferred it when teachers recognised them as individuals.

**Interaction and SLA: The Role and Power of Rising Intonation**

ABSTRACT

The interaction hypothesis states that second language acquisition (SLA) takes place best in an environment where meaning is negotiated between interlocutors using various feedback types.  To add to the body of work in determining whether or not interaction plays a role in SLA, this study examines and analyses the quality of interaction in an information gap activity between two participants – one L1 and one L2 English speaker.  Interesting findings in the data and pedagogical implications are discussed.

**Does Size Matter?: Learners' Self-reported Perceptions in a Small-sized EFL Class**

Min Lun Yeh, Ming Chi University of Technology, Taiwan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/9-1/yeh.pdf)

ABSTRACT

The study focuses on three aspects of EFL learning by identifying learners' self-reported perceptions of learning in a small-sized class compared with their previous experience from a larger class. A questionnaire was administered to 48 college freshman at a technical university in Taiwan. The results show that the participants generally have a positive attitude toward learning English in a small-sized class, finding it more conducive to learning, particularly appreciating the immediacy of error correction such a setting provides. Finally, the study explores the areas participants perceived to improve the most in a small class setting: oral communication ability, pronunciation, and listening, respectively.

**Suprasegmental Errors, Pronunciation Instruction and Communication**

ABSTRACT

This paper reports on findings from an investigation into the reason why 50 Vietnamese adult EFL learners have made so many pronunciation errors, particularly suprasegmental errors. The data of this qualitative research study provides evidence that pronunciation instruction was focused on individual sounds (segmentals) and tended to overlook suprasegmetals. Additionally, the study shows that lack of exposure to foreigners, both inside and outside the classroom, is one of the main factors in determining the participants’ pronunciation errors.

**What Teachers Can Do in the Pedagogical Trinity: Pragmatics, Grammar, and Communicative Language Teaching**

Sanae Oda-Sheehan, Ochanomizu University, Tokyo

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/8-2/oda-sheehan.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
While pragmatic awareness plays a vital role in developing communicative competence, it is less likely to be addressed in the Japanese EFL classroom partly due to lower pragmatic awareness among teachers. In fact, many cases of pragmatic failure are related to deficiencies of adequate teaching, which need to be urgently addressed in order to prevent learners from making unintentional mistakes. Towards that end, this study explores possible paths to promote pragmatic pedagogy and proposes one feasible approach, fully utilizing what is already available in the classroom – the integration of pragmatics and grammar pedagogy. Although grammar-oriented approaches are often cited as one of the causes for ineffective EFL learning, this integration can benefit the classroom where teachers need to satisfy various demands such as implementation of communicative language teaching (CLT) and preparation for college entrance exams. This approach will have great significance for teachers who struggle to balance those needs, especially for Japanese teachers of English (JTEs), many of whom believe that their strength is more likely to lie in their grammatical competence. The implications of this study may lead to more holistic approaches to L2 pragmatics with new teaching perceptions in the demanding EFL classroom.

**Issues in the Effectiveness of Early Exposure to Learning English in an EFL Environment**

Emiko Matsui, Sophia University and University of the Sacred Heart

Abstract:  
Since the Olympic Games will be held in Tokyo in 2020, there has been a growing interest not only in incorporating English in schools’ curricula but also in exposure to learning English from a younger age. In this paper, the author will discuss issues regarding early exposure to learning English from a Second Language Acquisition (SLA) point of view. This paper attempts to show the necessary ideas that need to be understood when making good decisions about English education in an EFL environment.

**The Effect of Popular American Films on Taiwanese University EFL Students' Perceptions of L2 Culture**  
Morgan William Dooley, Ming Chuan University

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/8-2/dooley.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
Film has been used for many university-level courses in Taiwan. Extant research, though, is limited regarding how this specific form of visual media may affect EFL students’ understanding of foreign or L2 culture. Hence, the purpose of this research is to discover if using this authentic material has significant impact on students’ L2 cultural learning. The 52 student participants were enrolled in a junior-level course at a northern Taiwan university. They first completed a quantitative attitudinal pre-test with Likert-type questions at the very beginning of the semester. After two months of instruction, the posttest identical to the pre-test was administered. Next, SPSS software was used to obtain the bivariate statistical data with t-tests for comparative analysis. Final results proved overall that popular American films affect participants’ L2 culture learning. These results provide EFL educators with an effective option for teaching this subject. In addition to providing the effective aspects of this approach, there are suggestions regarding how to manage some ineffective ones.

**Behind Japanese Students’ Silence in English Classrooms**  
Sachie Banks, Bunkyo University, Japan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/8-2/banks.pdf)

Abstract:  
This ethnographic study investigated what challenges Japanese university students faced in communicating in English with their teachers. The study focused on the functions of student-teacher interaction in English as a foreign language (EFL) contexts in Japan. Participant observations were conducted during two English classes and further data was collected from four students through semi-structured interviews. The study revealed three factors that could have interrupted student-teacher interaction: a collective communication system created by students, respect for their teacher and peers, and students’ higher expectations of what they should say. Academic support for teaching cultural differences in educational settings and encouraging students to speak up individually should contribute to communicative strengths in the classroom and wider intercultural situations.

**Integrating Research Approaches Toward Fluent EFL Literacy**  
Anna Husson Isozaki, Juntendo University

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/8-2/isozaki.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
Evidence has been accumulating regarding the specific challenges for reaching fluency in reading L2 English, particularly in EFL settings. Some interventions are showing potential value, according to recent cognitive and classroom research. Among these are incorporating multimedia, especially audio to make use of evidence of phonology’s facilitative role in building L2 reading, and also incorporating collaborative reading work in the classroom. This paper briefly reviews relevant research and develops an integrated skills approach to a proposed pedagogical intervention for university learners. Designed to collect qualitative and empirical data, this proposed action research is intended to explore and help clarify if integrating support for phonological awareness in collaborative classroom settings can improve EFL literacy experiences and acquisition for learners.

**Team Teaching in the English Classroom in Japan:** **A Call for Intercultural Communicative Competence Development**  
Jonathan David Brown, Yamanashi Gakuin University

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/8-2/brown.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
This study looks at the problems of team teaching in Japan through a review of earlier studies and a brief survey of elementary school Japanese and native-English teachers that was conducted by the author. The results of the survey corroborate earlier studies and suggest team teachers need Intercultural Communicative Competence (ICC) development to make team teaching more effective. Accordingly, this paper encourages those who are in a position to incorporate ICC development into teacher training programs to do so.

**An Argument for Stepping Back: A Comparative Analysis of L2 Interaction in Student-Student and Teacher-Student Dyads**  
Daniel Hooper, Kanda University of International Studies

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/8-2/hooper.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
Many scholars claim that interaction is an essential element in developing L2 competence. ELT professionals are therefore often concerned with creating scenarios where L2 interaction is being fostered. The purpose of this study was to investigate how differences in interlocutor can influence the amount and nature of interaction occurring within a communicative task. Utilizing a conversational analysis (CA) methodology, this study analyses conversation strings from two (student-student and teacher-student) dyads recorded during a picture dictation task. Transcriptions of the recorded data highlighted differences between the two dyads in the patterns of interaction that occurred. Interaction in the student-student data featured a higher amount of repair initiation sequences and conversation strategies than was found in the teacher-student group. Furthermore, whereas next turn repair initiation (NTRI) was frequent in the student-student dyad, repair initiation was significantly delayed in the teacher-student data. Potentially problematic examples of teacher talk were also identified from the teacher-student transcription. The results suggested that an expert-novice orientation in the teacher-student dyad may have created psychological constraints limiting the amount and type of interaction that occurred. This study provides further evidence of both the importance of peer interaction and the necessity for reflective inquiry in teachers’ professional development.

**The Global Academic Vocabulary Lexicon:** **A New ELT Resource**

Abstract:  
This article describes the Global Academic Vocabulary (GAV) lexicon, lessons, and platform that was initially implemented at International Christian University in Tokyo and is now under significant further development at the University of Melbourne and NYU-Tokyo. Research by Na and Nation has shown that understanding of about 95% of the words in an academic text is required for learners to confidently comprehend its meaning. But exactly what words do university learners need to know to achieve such a level of coverage? The GAV provides one important answer to this question by combining the headwords from the three most significant long-standing corpus-based vocabulary studies to date: the University Word List (UWL), the Academic Word List (AWL), and the English for Academic Purposes (EAP) word lists, with a fourth, the New Academic Word List (NAWL), now being added. This article provides the rationale behind the creation of the GAV.

**Metalanguage as a Component of the Communicative Classroom**  
Michael Jonathan Ellis, International Christian University High School

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/8-2/ellis.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
In this paper, the author reviews research on the use of metalanguage in language education to suggest that metalanguage has productive uses in communicative language teaching (CLT). First, there is an exploration of definitions which begins by borrowing Berry’s (2005) notion of metalanguage as an imprecise concept, indistinct from the target language. Then, the relevant aspects of SLA theory including metalinguistic knowledge, meaning-focus and focus on form, implicit and explicit knowledge, and languaging are explored to frame the potential utility of metalanguage. Finally, a summary of research on metalanguage is provided, followed by a discussion of conclusions. The findings indicate that metalanguage can be used productively in CLT if proper consideration is taken for students’ varied metalinguistic backgrounds and target language proficiency. Furthermore, written tasks with a goal of passive metalinguistic knowledge seemed to be better suited for metalinguistic instruction. In addition to its use during class time, metalanguage may be considered a learning strategy which leads to increased learner autonomy.
