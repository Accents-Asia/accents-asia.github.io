  - title: "Autonomy Enhancing Tools for Teacher Development"
    author: Jackie Suginaga, Komazawa Women’s University

    abstract: "Recent literature advocates that teacher education is most effective when it adopts a multi-perspective approach to teaching and learning through Reflective Practices, Action research, and Exploratory Practice. The meta-cognitive strategies developed through self-reflection can allow teachers to grow on professional as well as personal levels. In order for the teacher to foster autonomous learning, they must reflect on their own teaching and learning practices. This paper considers how teachers as learners can engage in this transformative process by infusing a blend of theoretical and practical dimensions of Reflective Practices which needs little time to implement yet brings a wealth of rewards to both teachers and their learners."

  - title: "Use of Corrective Feedback in the Classroom: A Reflective Analysis"
    author: Ethan Taomae, Teachers College Columbia University, Tokyo

    abstract: "Corrective feedback from teachers is an important part of the process of second language acquisition. Therefore teachers need to be aware of how they are providing feedback and how their students perceive it. In this study, the author used CA methodology to analyze how corrective feedback was provided in his class and found that recasts were the predominant form of correction. The analysis showed that recasts were effective when its purpose was salient to the student. However, recasts were often used as confirmation checks and this created an ambiguity which prevented the student from recognizing it as corrective feedback. An unexpected finding and one that showed the benefits of self-reflection was the realization of this author’s use of foreigner talk while providing corrective feedback."

  - title: "Language Shift and Revitalization"
    author: Peter Cassidy, Mitsui Gardens International Preschool (American Embassy Housing Compound, Tokyo)

    abstract: "The global spread of English has forced many cultures to adapt their language domain repertoires, and this language shift, in a worst-case scenario, can result in the death of a language, a change in cultural identity, and the loss of a cultural artifact. Organizations promoting the respect for local languages and the implementation of language revitalization strategies have many hindering factors to consider and the existence of linguistic feudalism and Darwinism lessens the effectiveness of certain programs hoping to revitalize local languages around the globe. Said attitudes about the relevance of a language, the language itself, the number of speakers, the medium for language acquisition and the availability of resources for promoting language acquisition all factor into the equation of language shift. Success stories are rare, but through planning and policy, formal education programs and community-based programs, local languages have a real chance of increasing certain domains of use."

  - title: "The Role of Phonological Memory and Vocabulary in Second Language Acquisition"
    author: Arthur Nguyen, Teachers College, Columbia University, Tokyo
    url: http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/4-2/nguyen.pdf
    abstract: "Vocabulary has long been an under-utilized aspect in English L2 instruction.  However, numerous studies have argued that vocabulary is a critical part of second language acquisition. This paper will argue this point, as well as explore how the mind processes and retains vocabulary.  A handful of case studies will be explored to better understand this link and show how pedagogical strategies can be created to help aid students in successfully learning and retaining vocabulary."
