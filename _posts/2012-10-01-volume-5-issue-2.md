  - title: "Looking for Common Ground: An Investigation of Motivation Strategies Valued by ALTs and JTEs"

    abstract: "Although the JET (Japan Exchange and Teaching) Programme and its Assistant Language Teachers (ALTs) have existed for more than a quarter century, many questions on how and to what extent ALTs ought to be utilized in the classroom still remain. Present research is largely concerned with discussions of cultural differences that impede successful team-teaching, or documentation of issues, such as ALT underutilization, rather than offering tangible solutions or program evaluation. Examining the teaching beliefs and attitudes toward student motivation of both ALTs and their Japanese counterparts (JTEs) is one possible step towards practical solutions to these issues. This paper outlines the results of a survey on the importance of motivational strategies given to ALTs and JTEs while providing concrete suggestions for how to better utilize ALTs in the way that draws from the common beliefs uncovered."

  - title: "Applying the Findings of Attribution Theory-Related Research to the College Foreign Language Classroom"

    abstract: "In this paper, the author first discusses how attributions, in general, play a role in student motivation regarding effort when attempting tasks and in coming to decisions of whether to continue or discontinue those efforts. In particular, the focus is on the context of Japanese EFL learners and their low self-esteem as competent language learners and users. The importance of enabling such students to gain a clear point of reference regarding their own personal progress and improvement, and the implications this has for their self-perception as successful and competent second language learners is explored through an action research project."

  - title: "Computer-Mediated Communicative Competence: How Email Facilitates Second-Language Learning"
    author: Matthew Klaus, Tamagawa Gakuen First-Division, Tokyo
    url: /issues/5-2/klaus.pdf
    abstract: "Computer-mediated communication (CMC) is an important medium by which teachers and students interact both inside and outside of the classroom. Unfortunately, CMC has received little attention in terms of second-language (L2) acquisition. This paper reviews a variety of recent research on CMC’s role in language teaching to provide a basis for understanding how the medium can aid L2 teaching and learning. The review shows that CMC’s role in L2 teaching is effective when the process is blended with explicit instruction and autonomous practice. However, this paper also illustrates how L2 learners lack pragmatic competence when using CMC that results in misunderstandings when student-to-teacher or native-to-non-native interaction occurred. The review concludes with pedagogical considerations for L2 teaching and learning."
