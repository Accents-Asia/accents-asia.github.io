  - title: "An Introduction to Flipped Learning"
    author: "Selinda England"
    url: "/issues/8-1/england.pdf"
    abstract: "Flipped Learning is a new, profound teaching philosophy, encouraging teachers to approach their classes in a modern way. Instead of the traditional, lecture-style format, educators use technology to become the “guide on the side”, tutoring students with hands-on activities. Classrooms which utilize Flipped Learning give students the power to learn independently, at home, while encouraging dynamic group discussions in class. (Sharples et al., 2014). In addition to an overview of the Flipped Classroom Method, this article will showcase several key technology tools to aid in instruction, for example, a) Movenote, b) Screencast-o-matic and c) QR codes."

  - title: "Scannable, Evernote, and Goodnotes – Building a Digital Writing Habit"
    author: "Matthew Keighley"
    url: "/issues/8-1/keighley.pdf"
    abstract: "In this paper, the author discusses the benefits of digitising handwritten work, such as student essays, for both student and teacher. In particular, laying out one method teachers might employ themselves as well as detailing a back up option for those working with less computer savvy students."

  - title: "Using Smartphones in the Language Classroom: Making the Most of Core Smartphone Apps"
    author: "Brett Milliner"
    url: "/issues/8-1/milliner.pdf"
    abstract: "Smartphones, tablets, and touch screen laptops, are powerful tools capable of accommodating hundreds of specialized, complex operations and applications to anyone, seemingly anywhere in the world. As close to all tertiary students own and/or have access to one of these devices, it is natural for language teachers to be interested in how these devices can be used to leverage the language learning process. This short paper considers some of the built-in, core applications or “apps” which come with smartphones when they are unboxed. The potential uses for voice recorders, video cameras, timers and digital cameras in the language classroom will all be presented in an effort to stress the importance and value of these language-learning tools."

  - title: "Learning through Watching: How to Use Movieclips.com as an Effective Learning Tool"
    author: "Michelangelo Magasic"
    url: "/issues/8-1/magasic.pdf"
    abstract: "This paper describes ways in which streaming video may be used as an effective learning tool. After outlining the utility of streaming video as a technology for L2 language learning, this paper provides two separate techniques through which streaming video might be employed in the classroom. The first way is a general viewing strategy through which students may familiarise themselves with new vocabulary and build confidence in foreign language media while the second method involves using the search function inherent to streaming video to find topical clips to help teach specific vocabulary or grammar points."

  - title: "Creating Reusable Pronunciation Pairs on Keynote"
    author: "Mary Nobuoka"
    url: "/issues/8-1/nobuoka.pdf"
    abstract: "One of the best language-focused learning activities to improve students’ pronunciation is drilling using pronunciation pairs. In this paper, participates will learn how to create a template slide using Mac Keynote, including pictures to help students understand the meaning of the words in the drill. Participants will be able to use these short drills in any class to help students become aware of and master the more challenging sounds in English."

  - title: "Using a Tablet Computer for Positive Self-review"
    author: "David Ockert"
    url: "/issues/8-1/ockert.pdf"
    abstract: "This paper reports the results of a small, exploratory, and longitudinal study which tested for the influence of video recording of students successfully speaking in the classroom and self-viewing with an iPad at a later date. The iPad video intervention, which allowed some of the students to view their successful use of English while speaking in front of their peers, is arguably a form of Positive Self Review (PSR; Dowrick, 1977). The results show that the students who received the iPad intervention had a non-statistically significant higher level of amotivation; statistically significant higher levels for the two most extrinsic motives (p < .05), including a higher level of the identified regulation items (Ideal L2 Selves; p < .10); and a statistically significant (p < .01) higher level for all three of the intrinsic motives: for knowledge, for stimulation, and for feelings of accomplishment. These results support Dörnyei’s L2 Motivational Self-System theory (2005, 2009). Finally, these results indicate that PSR may support student motivation for successful long term acquisition of EFL."

  - title: "Automatic Monitoring of Quick-Types: A Tool to Visualise Progress and Detect Cheating"
    author: "Malc Prentice"
    url: "/issues/8-1/prentice.pdf"
    abstract: "Quick-writes are a useful activity for increasing students' writing fluency. For those who need to take typed exams such as the TOEFL iBT, or use computers in the future for other tasks, a useful variation on this is the quick-type. However, when students are producing hundreds of pieces of writing on a variety of topics each week, it becomes difficult to monitor progress and detect cheating. This paper describes an open-source, cross-platform tool (created initially in response to student self-plagiarism) which analyses quick-types submitted by students via a Google Form and produces two reports: an easily interpreted visual overview of progress for students, and a summary report for teachers which flags possible problems for attention."

  - title: "Text and Corpora: Collocations, Constraints, and the Classroom"
    author: "Roy Randy Y. Briones"
    url: "/issues/8-1/briones.pdf"
    abstract: "This paper attempts to demonstrate collocation from a disaster-report article and how certain constraints in word-combinations influence collocability. These constraints are identified using corpus data followed by an enumeration of practical means of demonstrating these constraints vis-a-vis the teaching of vocabulary in the classroom. To achieve these, a 491-word online disaster-report on Typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan was selected. From this article, 13 nodes (words) and their corresponding collocates were identified to form a Semantic Field or node-collocate combination. Two fixed expressions were also identified from the said article. In order to identify the constraints that influence how words collocate or combine with other words, the following verbs from the above-mentioned Semantic Field were identified, “lash”, “struck”, “knocked out”, “ripped”, as well as the fixed expressions: “in the wake of” and “faced with a scenario”. Using Carter’s (1998) constraints on word-combinations in English, the relevant constraints on word-combinations of the above verbs and fixed expressions were identified using corpus data from the following corpora: ICE – Philippines, ICE – New Zealand, and the Brown Corpus. Lastly, upon identification of the constraints vis-à-vis the use of corpus data, ways on how teachers can demonstrate these word combination constraints in the classroom were presented."
