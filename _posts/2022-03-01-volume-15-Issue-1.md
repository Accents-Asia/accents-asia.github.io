  - title: "Do Teachers Have the Power to Shape Their Curriculum? Expectations and Responsibilities in Eikaiwas"

    abstract: "This research aims to investigate the perceived responsibilities and roles of teachers working in a small, English-language private school undergoing an overhaul of its curriculum.  Using research diaries and interviews between the researcher and teaching peers, and the researcher and school manager, this action research study investigates how each stakeholder envisions their role within the classroom and school, as well as their perceptions of the new teaching materials and updated teaching methods. Through analysis of interviews, research diaries, and test scores, it is evident that the teachers’ primary concerns are not with the material’s pedagogical focus but with the volume and complexity of material. The study provides a snapshot of a small school undergoing great change. The changing environment and stakeholders’ attitudes are analyzed and reflected upon, but this study does not track student outcomes long-term, nor how the teachers have developed their teaching and classrooms."
