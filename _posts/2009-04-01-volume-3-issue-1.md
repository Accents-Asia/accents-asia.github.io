  - title: "A Survey of Learner Expectations and Levels of Satisfaction with a University Intensive English Language Program"
    author: Stephen Russell

    abstract: "Differences between learner and teacher beliefs can often lead to a mismatch about what are considered useful classroom language learning activities. This exploratory classroom study stemmed from the author's desire to find out from the students themselves their preferred learning styles, reasons for joining the intensive English language program and, most importantly, to what extent the students felt their English had improved as a result of the course."

  - title: "Extensive Pair Taping for College Students in Japan: Action Research in Confidence and Fluency Building"
    author: Michael Kubo
    url: /issues/3-1/kubo.pdf
    abstract: "How can English as a Foreign Language (EFL) instructors effectively monitor and assess their students’ spoken second language (L2) production and progress?  By the same token, how can students track their own L2 speaking proficiencies as well as progress?  Pair Taping (PT) is one such method. The author takes a critical look at the literature relating to PT and EFL learner confidence, and applies them to his use of PT.  The author’s qualitative and quantitative research suggests that PT is an affective method in helping students bolster their spoken L2 (English) self-confidence and fluency, providing both student and teacher with valuable insights."
