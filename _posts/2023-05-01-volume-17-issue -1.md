**ABSTRACT**  
Every year, the Yokohama Chapter of the Japan Association for Language Teaching holds My Tech Share and My Share events in June and December respectively. In these workshops, presenters explain and demonstrate practical ideas for language teaching. This year’s Special Issue consists of three papers in which presenters expand on their ideas and give further details of the theoretical basis for their work.
