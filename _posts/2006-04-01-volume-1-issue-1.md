    abstract: This study’s objective was to assess high school students’ attitudes to studying global issues. Both qualitative and quantitative means were used to accumulate data and responses were tabulated, coded and analyzed.  Results show that the majority of students think learning about global issues is interesting and it makes them more enthusiastic to continue studying English. Although some students said the global issues content was very serious and difficult, many reported that their vision and understanding of the world had deepened. This study’s conclusions indicate that students believe they can simultaneously develop their English language skills while studying global issues.

  - title: "Classroom Anxiety: How Does Student Attitude Change in English Oral Communication Class in a Japanese Senior High School?"

    abstract: In spite of the government’s emphasis on the acquisition of practical English communication skills in upper secondary education, students’ reluctance to speak English in the classroom remains problematic in Japanese senior high schools. This paper explores how student attitudes might change in the classroom. After examining student expectations and goals in an English oral communication class, experiments were made to find how students might react to the new instruction style, including group work and presentation. Student attitudes changed depending on the instruction styles as well as on the system of their own choice of materials. Peer relationships also affected student attitudes. The teacher’s attempt to provide a comfortable environment in the classroom was the key to changing student attitudes.
