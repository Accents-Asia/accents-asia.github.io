    author: "Dan Ferreira, Seikei University, Tokyo, Japan, John Peloghitis, International Christian University, Tokyo, Japan"
    abstract: "In the past decade, universities have increasingly invested in Learning Management Systems (LMSs) to enhance language learning, aiming for efficiency and flexibility. However, LMS adoption alone does not guarantee success; multiple factors include instructor attitudes toward technology and system quality have been found to be relevant. This paper delved into the factors that shaped LMS adoption by examining teacher perceptions and experiences and LMS attributes. This paper discusses a study utilizing duoethnography to explore the personal challenges English as a foreign language teachers face when adopting LMSs in Japanese universities. Employing the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the study empirically assesses how teacher perceptions and experiences impact LMS adoption. Personal diaries, journals, reflections, and artwork from two instructors at Japanese universities were collected. The findings highlight three key external factors, system quality, perceived self-efficacy, and facilitation conditions, significantly influencing teachers' responses to LMS adoption. These results support prior research on LMS adoption factors and reaffirm the TAM's credibility in understanding teachers' technology adoption behavior. This study contributes to the literature, aiding administrators and teachers in addressing these issues within language learning programs. This study concluded by outlining administrator training strategies, tools for assessing teacher computer proficiency, and creating conducive conditions for LMS utilization."
