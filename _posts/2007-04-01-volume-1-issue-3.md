Abstract:  
When working within the confines of the Grammar Translation Method (GTM), it can seem an impossible task to introduce a global issues curriculum.  The author proposes that the goals of an institution (high scores on entrance exams) and the goals of the Global Issues educator need not be in conflict.  This ambitious experiment, conducted over the course of four months at an academic secondary school in Japan, illustrates the importance of preparing young people to be global citizens,  and the flexibility that can be found in a seemingly uncompromising academic environment.

Abstract:    
The author takes a critical look at the literature relating to pair taping (PT) and EFL learner confidence.  Using examples from his own practice, he suggests that it is imperative for EFL learners to engage the language outside the classroom, and by doing so, students can gain confidence and enhance their overall L2 competence.

Abstract:   
This paper examines five recently published research studies that address the impact computer technology has on ESL/EFL students’ reading comprehension skills, strategy use, vocabulary retention, writing skills, and learning preferences. The analysis of these research studies includes a brief description of the methods used in each study, a discussion of the important findings, and an evaluation of the conclusions drawn by the authors followed by suggestions for future research.
