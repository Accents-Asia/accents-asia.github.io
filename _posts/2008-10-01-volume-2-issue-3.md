Abstract:   
This paper’s objective is to introduce the strategies employed in the “Narrow to Broad Perspectives (NBP)” approach to second language learning designed by the author to develop autonomous language learning and learner potential. Several stages are incorporated into each lesson to illustrate the interrelatedness and gap between the narrow and broad perspectives. The teaching emphasizes that it is significant to view things from a broadened perspective since broadening our personal dimensions as well as those of others dynamically causes some change in ourselves and the world. The NBP approach may generate positive changes in attitude to learning English and learner potential.

Abstract:   
This essay argues for the centrality of metapragmatic awareness to language teaching. It examines literature on teacher language awareness and how it relates to pragmatics, thereby requiring a deeper analysis of the types of competencies necessary for one to be an effective second language teacher. It gives an overview of how teacher awareness of the basic tenets of pragmatics can assist in facilitating meaningful and practical classroom activities.
