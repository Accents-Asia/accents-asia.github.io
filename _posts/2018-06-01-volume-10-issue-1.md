      abstract: "Research has shown that motivation is intimately connected to language proficiency (Dörnyei, 1994), yet little has been done to show how personality might be connected to both personality and proficiency in Japanese undergraduate students. This study examined the connection between the five-factor model of personality traits and the second language (L2) motivational self system, and how both constructs relate to self-perceived proficiency. Participants completed the Ten Item Personality Inventory in Japanese (TIPI-J) along with a measure of the L2 motivational self system. Students from two Japanese universities took part in this study (N = 228). The results showed that extroversion and openness correlated with the L2 motivational self system, while conscientiousness and openness correlated with perceived proficiency."

    - title: "Examining the Role of Model Texts in Writing Instruction"

      abstract: "Model texts are a common tool writing teachers utilize to assist students in tackling new, unfamiliar genres. Model texts provide a concrete example for learners to understand what is to be expected as a finished product and to process the rhetorical structures, conventions, and organizational features within the text. By noticing and developing an awareness of rhetorical modes, L2 learners can eventually apply their knowledge more creatively in future writing tasks. The following paper reviews the existing literature concerning the effectiveness and application of model texts in writing. An overview of the advantages and disadvantages in how model texts are implemented˛ highlights some of the pertinent issues related to the teaching and learning practices. Lastly, although scholars have generally advocated the use of models in the literature and have been applied in empirical studies, little has been written which specifically addresses the practical needs of teachers. Thus, this paper offers instructors several guidelines to consider when incorporating model texts into the writing process."
