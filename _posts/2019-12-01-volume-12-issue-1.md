    abstract: "This special issue of Accents Asia is a by-product of the 2018/19-season ETJ Tokyo ELT Expo and Book Fair, which was held on 22nd and 23rd February, 2019 at Otsuma Women's University, Chiyoda Campus, Tokyo. It represents a new aspect of the ETJ Tokyo Expo, whereby local teachers who gave non-commercial presentations were invited to write up their content as a paper, and submit it for publication. The requirements for presentations were that the content should be about language teaching or learning, and that they should not promote a product or service for profit or gain. This meant the potential scope of papers was quite wide, and the organisers anticipated articles ranging from the results of empirical studies to descriptions of favourite lesson plans."

  - title: "Device Tools: An Alternative Approach to Language Learning with an iPad"
    author: Kayvon Havaei-Ahary
    url: "/issues/12-1/havaei-ahary.pdf"
    abstract: "This special issue of Accents Asia comprises papers written by six of the presenters that spoke that day in June. Kayvon Havaei-Ahary explored the features and device tools available on iPads and explained how the language to use them effectively could become an integral part of the language learning experience. Gota Hayashi introduced research on a survey that he created to aid students’ development of self-regulation skills and intrapersonal intelligence. Mary Nobuoka shared The Dictionary Game, a clever way of teaching students vocabulary while also supporting the development of critical thinking skills. Lucinda and Yusuke Okuyama shared the process by which they worked with students to develop and produce a set of reflective practice questions for EFL teachers to use for improving their practice. Finally, Paul Raine introduced Talk Corpus, an app to aid effective use of TED Talks in the second language classroom by helping educators identify appropriately leveled talks for student proficiency levels."
