      abstract: "In December, 2020, the JALT Yokohama (YoJALT) chapter hosted their annual winter My Share event, which invited chapter and other local JALT members to share practical and innovative classroom activities and ideas. As always, the participants in this My Share did not disappoint. What follows is a collection of seven papers fleshing out the details of many, but not all, presenters' talks that day. We hope you enjoy this issue as much as we enjoyed putting it together."
