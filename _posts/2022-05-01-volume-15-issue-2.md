  - title: "Not Just Surviving, but Thriving: Motivation and Job Crafting Techniques of Long-term _eikaiwa_ Teachers"

    abstract: "Despite the widespread view within Japanese ELT (English language teaching) of eikaiwa (private English conversation school) teaching as entry-level, the often-disparaging mass media coverage it receives (Crooks, 2010; McCrostie, 2014; McNeill, 2004; McNeil, 2019), and the high turnover of instructors (McNeill, 2004), many teachers have sustained their motivation for the job. Using Braun and Clarke’s (2012) framework for deductive thematic analysis and semi-structured interviews with eikaiwa teachers who have worked in the industry for more than a decade, this study aims to shed some light on the professional lives of these long-term eikaiwa teachers. In particular, the study explores the extent to which the teachers’ basic psychological needs as defined within self-determination theory are satisfied or frustrated. This study also explores the methods these teachers use to maintain their motivation by job crafting (Berg, et al., 2007)."

  - title: "Examining the Use of L1 by Native-level English Teachers"
    author: "Simon Bannister, Kanda University of International Studies"

    abstract: "Throughout the world of English as a Foreign Language (EFL), there is a predominant mantra of “English-only” (monolingual) classes and the idea that absolute immersion in the target language will enable learners to maximise their learning potential. Especially in the context of native-level English teachers (NETs), many of whom do not share the same mother tongue as their learners, it is understandable that this overriding belief exists. This mixed-methods study was conducted to assess the extent to which NETs use L1 in EFL classes in the Greater Tokyo Area for ‘academic’, ‘managerial’, and ‘social & cultural’ aspects of EFL pedagogy as well as to examine their attitudes towards this approach. Overall, it was found that NETs do not use L1 to a great extent, but attitudes towards the facilitative use of L1 for ‘academic’ purposes were generally positive."
