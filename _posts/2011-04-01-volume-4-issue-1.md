**Newspaper Subjectivity from Multimodal Perspectives**

Abstract:  
The author argues for the need to examine how the secondary mode (visuals) in newspaper reports functions and affects the overall nature of the medium, and what interpersonal relationship such text is trying to establish with readers. In this information age, a considerable amount of information people are exposed to has multi-modal structures, and as new technologies appear on the marketplace and quickly blend into people’s daily lives, literacy requirements change (Luke, 2000). Acquiring necessary “multi-modal literacy” (Unsworth, 2001) to take critical viewpoints toward the information not only in the linguistic mode but also in other modes is then very important.

Abstract:  
The question posed for this paper is regarding Japanese returnee students, since according to Hansen, the documentation on Japanese returnees’ loss of ESL is still　fragmentary (Hansen & Kurashige, 1999). This paper analyzes six primary articles that examine current attrition research of Japanese returnees in order to formulate pedagogical implications.

Abstract:  
This study evaluates practical phonological competence in Japanese native speakers (JNS) at the first and second year college level in terms of production and recognition of second language (L2) phones. Methodology in the first part of the study involves 100 JNS listeners attempting to differentiate and identify L2 phones produced by an English native speaker (ENS) in 1 and 2 syllable words. In the second part of the study, the same words are produced on videotape by a group of 5 JNS readers for 2 ENS groups: 23 residents of Japan and 31 U.S. residents. Results from this learner group indicate a consistent pattern of significant deficiencies in the ability to produce and recognize L2 phones.

It provides some basic guidelines for teachers new to such interviews on how to conduct a successful interview.
