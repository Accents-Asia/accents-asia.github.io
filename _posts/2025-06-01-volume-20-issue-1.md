      abstract: "At the Yokohama chapter of the Japan Association for Language Teaching, we hold regular My Share events. The most recent was in December 2024 and was held on the Hiyoshi Campus of Keio University. Three presenters shared their experiences and practical ideas for language teaching and learning.
