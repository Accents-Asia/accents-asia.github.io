    - title: "Emphasizing Content in the English Composition Classroom in Japan"
      author: Jonathan Brown, University of Yamanashi, Kofu
      url: /issues/5-1/brown.pdf
      abstract: "This paper attempts to briefly explain why an overemphasis of grammar and vocabulary in the writing classroom is ineffective at building ESL students’ writing abilities beyond the basic level and how an emphasis on content can help to improve these writing abilities.  Several exercises taken from an actual English writing textbook used in Japanese high schools will be used to 1) demonstrate how grammar and vocabulary is the predominant focus in the English composition classroom in Japan, and 2) how easily an instructor might integrate content into the writing exercises without needing to make large changes or restructure the curriculum."

    - title: "Searching for a New Approach to Listening"
      author: Matthew P. Wallace, Kanto International High School, Tokyo
      url: /issues/5-1/wallace.pdf
      abstract: "Listening is an essential skill for learners to develop as they acquire a new language. Unfortunately, it has received little attention in the language classroom and language learning literature. This article reviews the current literature on second language listening skill development. Evidence from the review indicates the current approach to pedagogical listening is inadequate in addressing the needs of second language learners. As a result, an eclectic approach, combining the current approach and the process approach is proposed. The review concludes with pedagogical implications for the language listening classroom."

    - title: An Evolving Philosophy of Teaching
      author: Reiko S. Takeda, Teachers College, Columbia University, Tokyo
      url: /issues/5-1/takeda.pdf
      abstract: "In this article, which was a writing assignment for the Integrated Skills Practicum, a course at Teachers College, Columbia University in Tokyo, the author reflects on how the course has helped shape her teaching philosophy since its start in January 2011. Here, she focuses on how she works with students, her observations of her classes as a language teacher, and her development as a teaching professional."
    
    - title: "Issues in Second Language Listening Comprehension and the Pedagogical Implications"
      author: Tomoko Kurita, Teachers College, Columbia University, Tokyo
      url: /issues/5-1/kurita.pdf
      abstract: "Listening is an important language skill to develop in terms of second language acquisition (SLA). In spite of its importance, second language (L2) learners often regard listening as the most difficult language skill to learn. This paper reviews a variety of recent research on listening comprehension to provide a basis for creating more effective listening instruction. It begins with a brief discussion of listening processes for comprehension and acquisition, followed by reviewing cognitive research, linguistic research and affective research on listening comprehension, and discusses implications of teaching L2 listening for comprehension and acquisition. The paper concludes that current research on listening comprehension has revealed the importance of metacognitive knowledge, lexical knowledge and prosodic cues including stress and intonation as well as reducing anxiety in the development listening comprehension."
    
    - title: "EFL Journal Writing: An Exploratory Study in Self-expression as a Bridge for Creative Writing"
      author: Asako Takaesu, International Christian University, Tokyo
      url: /issues/5-1/takaesu.pdf
      abstract: "This study examines how reflective journal writing affected college students in a creative writing course and explores key factors to ensure a successful journal writing process. The qualitative data analysis based on students’ journal entries and three surveys administered over the course of nine weeks indicate that the activity allowed students to deepen their self-awareness, served as a springboard for more elaborate creative pieces they later pursued, changed their attitude toward writing in English and enhanced their confidence, and increased their motivation for more challenging writing tasks. Trying to create an environment where students feel unthreatened by overly strict academic writing rules and having them keep a journal on a regular basis appear to play key roles in promoting a successful journal writing process."

    - title: "Applying SLA Research and Theory to Practice: Cooperative Output-focused Activities for an EFL Reading Classroom in Japan"
      author: Miyoko Okazaki, Aoyama Gakuin University, Tokyo
      url: /issues/5-1/okazaki.pdf
      abstract: "The intent of this article is to encourage English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers to experiment with the practical application from second language acquisition (SLA) research and theory by sharing ideas for classroom activities. The activities proposed are for classroom teachers to incorporate some aspects of SLA research and theory in a communicative classroom. The article begins by reviewing the important SLA research and theory related to noticing, output, and interaction, followed by the current trend of effective pedagogical approaches and how they relate to the research and theory. Then the article discusses key common challenges in teaching English in Japan. Finally, activities for an EFL reading classroom with applying the described research and theory are presented. The activities attempt to encourage cooperative output-focused activities for EFL reading classrooms in Japan."

    - title: "The Effectiveness of Shadowing on Students' Psychology in Language Learning"
      author: Kazuko Shiota, Sophia University, Tokyo
      url: /issues/5-1/shiota.pdf
      abstract: "Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of shadowing on English skills, but few have investigated its impact on learners' emotions. This study looks at how shadowing affects novice college students' psychology, which is typically low on intrinsic motivation in the Grammar-Translation Method and high on anxiety in the Communicative Approach. Data collected suggests that shadowing could be a useful technique to solve problems in students' attitudes towards second language learning."

    - title: "Book Review: Refining Composition Skills: Academic Writing and Grammar (6th edition) by R. M. Smalley, M.K. Ruetten, and J.R. Kozyrev (2011)"
