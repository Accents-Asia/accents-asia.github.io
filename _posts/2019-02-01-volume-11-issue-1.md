    abstract: "This paper presents the findings of a longitudinal pilot study to determine whether an autonomous language program consisting solely of Silent Shadowing Training results in noticeable second language learning gains. To test this hypothesis, the author silently shadowed a Japanese audiobook for 200 hours over six months on his daily commutes to work. Language proficiency was monitored by three videotaped interviews conducted in Japanese: a pre-test taken before beginning shadowing training, an intermediary-test recorded at three months, and a post-test at six months. At the end of the experiment, the author’s Japanese language ability was evaluated by ten native Japanese teachers who viewed the videos and completed an online survey. The results provide preliminary evidence that the silent shadowing of audiobooks during daily commutes can be an effective learning strategy in the development of L2 conversational abilities. Implications for classroom and autonomous language learning programs are also discussed."

  - title: "Aspects of Word Knowledge: An Investigation of the Explicit Exemplification of Aspects of Word Knowledge in a Global Textbook used in South Korea."

    abstract: "The term ‘lexical item’ has proved useful in identifying pieces of language which operate as single units. The extent of knowledge required to master these items is more extensive than many teachers and learners may realise. This study aims to learn whether one specific textbook explicitly addresses the full depth of knowledge in activities for its selected lexical items. A framework was developed to analyse the textbook and each unit was examined with a primary focus on the vocabulary sections. Which knowledge aspects in each activity were being exemplified was determined and a count was taken for each. The results reveal that ‘form and meaning’ clearly dominate attention given in activities. A few other aspects (spoken form, written form, word parts) receive some attention but many receive very little or no attention at all. This study advises that the four learning partners (students, teachers, materials writers and researchers) need to be aware of the lexical impact in language and material writers should explicitly address the depth of lexical item knowledge in textbooks"
