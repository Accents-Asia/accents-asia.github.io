Accents Asia aims to provide a forum for teachers working throughout East Asia to share their ideas and research with other educators who could most benefit from their important work. Increasingly, graduate students are turning to electronic sources to find reference materials for their own research, and _Accents_ aims to make a meaningful contribution to the wealth of quality scholarly research already available on the Internet. We hope that you join us in this mission to accent English education by sharing your work with educators in Asia - and the world.  
  
While much of the research here is by alumni of TC Japan, we welcome research from professionals working throughout Asia. Articles may be viewed individually and APA reference information appears at the top of each article.

This journal is completely free and open access.
