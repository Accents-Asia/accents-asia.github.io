**A Duoethnography of the Elucidation of Teacher Agency of Digital Tools for Teaching English as a Foreign Language During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japanese Universities**

Dan Ferreira, Seikei University, and John Peloghitis, International Christian University

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/16-2/Ferreira_Peloghitis.pdf)

**ABSTRACT**

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, a lack of decisive leadership from Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) resulted in each Japanese university implementing ad-hoc emergency measures for teaching. Although the majority of universities started teaching online three years later (in 2022), university teachers are expected to teach in a variety of contexts — online, face-to-face, or a hybrid of the two. To date, there is scant literature reporting on the ongoing tension between teachers who want to exert agency over the use of instructional and communication tools (ICT) under such circumstances and university policy on the sanctioned use of digital tools during this ongoing crisis. Adopting a duoethnographic approach, this study aims to elucidate teacher agency of digital tools for teaching English as a foreign language (EFL) in Japanese higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. In duoethnography, new knowledge is discoverable from the individual lived experience, and the study findings offer societal implications to enhance the meaning of the phenomenon or inform educational leadership with further insights regarding teaching English as a foreign language in Japanese tertiary education. The findings of this study show that the insights provided by the duoethnographic method not only provide a cathartic salve by which teachers can constructively overcome negative teaching circumstances on an individual level but also warrants further research to explore teachers’ similar experiences in other teaching contexts on a global scale. 

**The Role of CALL in Japanese Public Schools: Perspectives of Foreign and Native Teachers**

Michelle Lees and Andria Lorentzen, Kanda University of International Studies, Japan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/16-2/Lees_Lorentzen.pdf)

  
**ABSTRACT**

This paper combines two mixed-methods research projects in Japan that investigated the current status of technology in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education to gain deeper insights on how and why technology is used in the Japanese public school system. The aim of these two studies was to identify the factors related to the role of Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) in EFL classes involving both Japanese and foreign language teachers of English. Questionnaires collected qualitative and quantitative data from 99 participants, which included 49 Japanese Teachers of English (JTEs) and 50 English Assistant Language Teachers (ALTs). The findings indicated that although JTEs had a positive attitude towards technology, external factors such as time, training, and experience resulted in a reluctance to utilize it when teaching. In response to this finding, a number of practical recommendations were developed to promote technology usage in the EFL classroom.

**Integrating Debiasing Strategies to Facilitate Improved Critical Thinking in Language Learning Contexts​**

John Peloghitis and Guy Smith, International Christian University

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/16-1/PELOGHITIS_SMITH.pdf)

**ABSTRACT**

Since the 1970s, scholars from a variety of disciplines have identified numerous cognitive biases and examined how they can impede rational decision-making. Despite the overwhelming evidence from these empirical studies, critical thinking pedagogy has largely ignored this body of work. This paper maintains that critical thinking instruction needs to adopt a new framework, one that considers the importance of cognitive biases. This paper first explains how cognitive bias can surface and negatively impact tasks that typically occur in language learning contexts, and secondly, it aims to describe several debiasing strategies and interventions to equip language teachers with the tools to facilitate a framework that encourages students to critically question ideas and sources, seek diversity of opinion, and slow the thinking process. Current literature on cognitive bias and debiasing is reviewed, followed by an explanation of how teachers can integrate strategies in two common language learning tasks.

**Not Just Surviving, but Thriving: Motivation and Job Crafting Techniques of Long-term _eikaiwa_ Teachers**  
James Taylor, International College of Technology, Kanazawa, Japan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/15-2/taylor.pdf)

**ABSTRACT**

Despite the widespread view within Japanese ELT (English language teaching) of eikaiwa (private English conversation school) teaching as entry-level, the often-disparaging mass media coverage it receives (Crooks, 2010; McCrostie, 2014; McNeill, 2004; McNeil, 2019), and the high turnover of instructors (McNeill, 2004), many teachers have sustained their motivation for the job. Using Braun and Clarke’s (2012) framework for deductive thematic analysis and semi-structured interviews with eikaiwa teachers who have worked in the industry for more than a decade, this study aims to shed some light on the professional lives of these long-term eikaiwa teachers. In particular, the study explores the extent to which the teachers’ basic psychological needs as defined within self-determination theory are satisfied or frustrated. This study also explores the methods these teachers use to maintain their motivation by job crafting (Berg, et al., 2007).

**Examining the Use of L1 by Native-level English Teachers**

Simon Bannister, Kanda University of International Studies

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/15-2/bannister.pdf)

**ABSTRACT**

Throughout the world of English as a Foreign Language (EFL), there is a predominant mantra of “English-only” (monolingual) classes and the idea that absolute immersion in the target language will enable learners to maximise their learning potential. Especially in the context of native-level English teachers (NETs), many of whom do not share the same mother tongue as their learners, it is understandable that this overriding belief exists. This mixed-methods study was conducted to assess the extent to which NETs use L1 in EFL classes in the Greater Tokyo Area for ‘academic’, ‘managerial’, and ‘social & cultural’ aspects of EFL pedagogy as well as to examine their attitudes towards this approach. Overall, it was found that NETs do not use L1 to a great extent, but attitudes towards the facilitative use of L1 for ‘academic’ purposes were generally positive.

**Do Teachers Have the Power to Shape Their Curriculum? Expectations and Responsibilities in Eikaiwas**  
Isobel Hook, Konan Women’s University, Japan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/15-1/hook.pdf)

**ABSTRACT**

This research aims to investigate the perceived responsibilities and roles of teachers working in a small, English-language private school undergoing an overhaul of its curriculum.  Using research diaries and interviews between the researcher and teaching peers, and the researcher and school manager, this action research study investigates how each stakeholder envisions their role within the classroom and school, as well as their perceptions of the new teaching materials and updated teaching methods. Through analysis of interviews, research diaries, and test scores, it is evident that the teachers’ primary concerns are not with the material’s pedagogical focus but with the volume and complexity of material. The study provides a snapshot of a small school undergoing great change. The changing environment and stakeholders’ attitudes are analyzed and reflected upon, but this study does not track student outcomes long-term, nor how the teachers have developed their teaching and classrooms.

**L2 Motivation Patterns in EFL Japan of Different Groups of Learners**  
Hajime Tsuzuki, Kanda Institute of Foreign Languages, Japan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/14-2/Tsuzuki.pdf)

**ABSTRACT**

It is natural to assume that each language learner demonstrates his or her unique improvement curves. On the other hand, a clear trend was observed where four different demographic groups of learners, while presenting four respective and distinct trends of learning speed, all showed similar and overlapping patterns of improvement within his or her own group. The attempt of this research is to try to explain this phenomenon. The explanations will be made based solely on various motivational theories derived from the literature, without referring to other possible contributors such as individual aptitude factors. Through the process, the paper aims to first present what types of motivations exist in each, followed by ensuring logical connections between those existing motivations of each demographic group and their outcome pattern, particularly after more than 5 years of learning. As a consequence, it will show that while two of the four groups show only a limited amount of improvement, and a seemingly prospective group of business professionals fail to show any measurable progress, a group of younger learners consistently succeeds in their pursuit of both academic success and language mastery

**Sayonara to the Monolingual EFL Classroom?**  
Jackie M. Talken, Temple University, Japan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/14-1/talken.pdf)

**ABSTRACT**

The long-running debate over the acceptance of the learner’s L1 (first language) in the L2 (second language) classroom is particularly relevant in EFL (English as a Foreign Language) settings such as Japan (Weschler, 1997). The field of Second Language Acquisition has also seen a recent resurgence of interest in this topic (Bartlett, 2018; Kita, 2018); these studies among others will be discussed below. This paper will consider the views of learners and instructors as well as empirical, classroom-based research into relevant methods and strategies, including translation, code-switching and translanguaging. Factors such as the educational and cultural background of the instructor will also be discussed in relation to the pedagogical strategies employed by instructors. Research looking at a range of educational contexts, learner ages, and languages studied will be explored, in order to present as thorough a picture as possible of the most recent work being done in this area. The bulk of the research presented here points to the need for recognition that language learners are enhancing a single linguistic repertoire rather than attempting to emulate monolingual speakers of a language, and thus the importance of integrating the whole of a learner’s linguistic resources into instructional contexts.

**A Comparative Study of L2 Interactional Competence at a Japanese University**

David Shimamoto, Akita International University, Japan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/14-1/shimamoto.pdf)

**ABSTRACT**  
Interactional competence (IC) is not only predicated on grammar and vocabulary knowledge, but also necessitates a pragmatic understanding of when and why such resources should be employed. Norms for turn-taking, negotiation, repair, and speech acts, such as agreeing and disagreeing are prevalent in any interaction. What differentiates classroom talk from other types of discourse is the power teachers possess to control verbal exchange. This study investigates the talk-in-interaction of a Japanese EFL university classroom in an attempt to demonstrate (1) how students navigate within the institutionalized parameters of teacher-fronted talk and (2) how the sequential organization of interaction changes during student-student group discussions. Conversation analysis was used to examine the interactional practices performed in these two common classroom settings. The results indicate that while the IC displayed during teacher-fronted discussion revolved around the ubiquitous initiation-response-feedback (IRF) sequence, learners demonstrated dissimilar IC while engaged in group discussion. Participation rights and discourse identities are discussed to elucidate the differences found between the two interactional environments. The findings presented in this paper evidence the need for teachers to consider how the underlying conditions of interactional contexts can ultimately lead to the development of equally important but inherently different interactional skills.

**Students' Behaviors and Perceptions Using an LMS**  
Yuka Eto, Chuo University, Japan  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/14-1/eto.pdf)

**ABSTRACT**  
In order to gain an insight on the students' learning behaviors and perceptions towards using a Learning Management System (LMS), this study was conducted in a Japanese university where the usage of LMS is not common. The students' homework results and survey responses were analyzed to understand the impact of implementing a curriculum with homework submission on an LMS. The author argues that technology can be effectively used in the curriculum to increase learning engagement of students at home and improve the relationship between the students and instructor. In addition, the researcher found students to feel generally positive about using an LMS in class even when they are not familiar with such systems. Issues discussed in the study can provide some ideas for educators to improve their teaching through the usage of an LMS, especially where there is currently no usage of technology.

**Linking Language-learning Concepts with Active-learning Concepts in Foreign-language Education**

Eric Buck, Kanda University of International Studies, Japan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/13-1/buck.pdf)

**ABSTRACT**

As the emphasis on active learning grows with educational policy reforms in Japan, learner engagement is a prominent issue. High-stakes tests and examinations compel teachers to rely, sometimes heavily, on certain forms of rote drilling that lack potential to stimulate and engage learners in the ‘active learning’ sense, and, instead, involve a much more passive learning experience. This paper examines intriguing similarities between extracts from literature on active learning and literature concerning L2 output production in language learning contexts. In particular, specific descriptions of processes involved in active learning are similar in a number of ways to the potential learning benefits thought to be made available when producing modified L2 output in response to interlocutor feedback. These parallels are displayed and explained for the purpose of situating definitions of active learning within some of the conceptuality of language learning. Following this, examples of possible styles and formats of language drills are used as a basis for portraying the dichotomy between active and passive learning. It is concluded that more active forms of drilling involving authentic learner production can reveal more about the current state of a learners’ interlanguage and provide more opportunities to attend to their needs regarding the development of this interlanguage.  

**A Qualitative Action Research Study of the Barriers to Information and Communication Technology Integration at a Japanese Liberal Arts College**  
Dan Ferreira, Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/13-1/ferreira.pdf)

**ABSTRACT**  
The purpose of this qualitative action research study was to explore the perceptions and experiences of English as a foreign language (EFL) university teachers in Eastern Japan to overcome barriers to integrate information and communication technology (ICT) in their daily teaching practice. The problem addressed was that universities in Japan are pressured to align their curriculums with government initiatives that demand ICT integration. However, governmental guidelines for faculty development have not been developed. The research setting was a liberal arts college in Eastern Japan, and purposeful sampling was used to attain a sample of 12 EFL university teachers. Activity Theory served as the theoretical framework. The MAXQDA 12 software was used to identify codes, patterns, and themes across the data. The three major themes were: (a) no computer, no projector, and no Internet were faculty barriers to ICT integration, (b) difficult software for teaching purposes was a barrier to ICT integration, and (c) faculty contemplation of learning objectives/outcomes informed decisions to integrate ICT successfully. Recommendations for educational leadership included (a) to equip every classroom with an Internet-connected computer/projector and to ensure these devices were maintained regularly, (b) to provide reliable Wi-Fi to improve adoption of ICT, (c) to create a theoretically-driven ICT training program tied to curriculum learning objectives, and (d) to hire educational technologists to provide “just-in-time” techno-pedagogical support.

**ABSTRACT**

This issue of Accents Asia is a selection of papers written by seven of the presenters. Samuel Bruce offers some very practical advice on how to design an effective academic poster. Keith Hoy examined the effectiveness of two visual prompts: timelines and visual metaphors, used to introduce an English-based content course focusing on contemporary cultural issues. Jon Shepard traces one language learner’s path to becoming a more successful student. Lucinda and Yusuke Okuyama consider the learning app, Edmodo® (edmodo.com) as a pervasive learning platform. Brooks Slaybaugh introduces peer-assessment as a way to improve in-class discussions. A series of performance-based activities targeting the enhancement of EFL students’ self-concept and sense of agency are described by Rashad DuPaty. And, in the final article, Lucinda and Yusuke Okuyama utilize a youth participatory evaluation approach to establish which strategies EFL students at the university level in Japan exercise to succeed in the classroom. The authors then worked with focus groups to co-create a reflective practice tool for maintaining learners’ focus on the effective learning strategies.

ABSTRACT 

This special issue of Accents Asia is a by-product of the 2018/19-season ETJ Tokyo ELT Expo and Book Fair, which was held on 22nd and 23rd February, 2019 at Otsuma Women's University, Chiyoda Campus, Tokyo. It represents a new aspect of the ETJ Tokyo Expo, whereby local teachers who gave non-commercial presentations were invited to write up their content as a paper, and submit it for publication. The requirements for presentations were that the content should be about language teaching or learning, and that they should not promote a product or service for profit or gain. This meant the potential scope of papers was quite wide, and the organisers anticipated articles ranging from the results of empirical studies to descriptions of favourite lesson plans.

ABSTRACT  
Like other ESL/EFL buzzwords such as Content-Based Instruction (CBI) and Task-based Learning (TBL), Integrated-skills Instruction is a popular catchphrase that encompasses a range of classroom practices. However, unlike these other terms that have much literature devoted to them, there has been far less discussion of the varieties of integrated-skills instruction. On the one hand, this is unsurprising. Skills-integration is probably best thought of not as an instructional approach in itself, but a corollary or byproduct of other approaches such as CBI and TBL that take principles other than the mastery of discrete skills as their instructional entry point (see Oxford, 2001). On the other hand, considering the ubiquity of the term and its use among practitioners, course designers, and textbook publishers, it is worthwhile digging deeper into the concept to gain a clearer understanding of its attributes and applications. This paper aims to bring greater clarity to the term by proposing the following distinctions: global/local and strong/weak skills integration. To illustrate them, the authors present syllabi and classroom activities from university, secondary, and elementary school contexts in Japan. 

**Facilitating Revision Skill in L2 Writing Instruction: The Roles of Teacher and Peer Feedback**  
Sachiko Igarashi, Koka Gakuen Junior and Senior High School for Girls, Tokyo  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/11-2/igarashi.pdf)

  
ABSTRACT   
This paper seeks to investigate the roles of teacher and peer feedback that will facilitate revision in L2 writing instruction. Research suggests that revision is regarded as a vital stage of the entire process of writing and plays a key role to prompt L2 acquisition. Given this, writing teachers or researches have raised a growing concern about the use of teacher commentary and peer response for effective L2 learner revision. Although feedback differs in terms of types, approaches, effectiveness, goals or other aspects, it is extremely important that writing teachers make most use of teacher and peer feedback with a critical, analytical and evaluative view and sufficient understanding of the features for each feedback. The paper concludes that L2 learners will be able to foster self-revision skills and build their own autonomy in writing with the support of feedback during the interim phase of developing L2 writing skills.

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/11-2/listyani_tananuraksakul.pdf)

  
ABSTRACT   
Second language learners often find obstacles in their journey to reach target-language competence.  Three of them are related to motivation, self-confidence, and anxiety.  Motivation is about the personal drive or desire to learn the target language, while self-confidence is related to the learners’ belief or trust on their abilities to be successful in learning.  Anxiety means students’ nervousness or worry when they face something difficult or uncomfortable.  This paper deals with a study conducted to seek the differences between second language learners from Indonesia and Thailand in terms of motivation, self-confidence, and anxiety.  Participants were Indonesian and Thai students.  Twenty Indonesian students were taking an academic writing class in Semester Antara (Short Semester) of 2017-2018 Academic Year, at the English Language Education (ELE) Study Program of Universitas Kristen Satya Wacana (UKSW).  This course was offered in their third year of college.  Twenty-one Thai students were also taking an academic writing course in their third year.  One central question to be answered is: is there any difference between Indonesian and Thai students in terms of motivation, self-confidence, and self-esteem.  Data were mainly derived from open-ended questionnaires distributed to twenty students of Academic Writing class in the ELE study program, (Faculty of Language and Arts) FLA, UKSW Salatiga, Indonesia, and 21 students majoring in the English language from Huachiew Chalermprakiet University Thailand.  Findings showed that students from both countries were very much influenced by parental factors.

ABSTRACT

This paper presents preliminary research into how Japanese teachers of English (JTEs) perceive their readiness in addressing the needs of students with learning disabilities, and what specific concerns they may have in ensuring a productive and healthy classroom learning environment for everyone. Using a qualitative, inductive research design, teacher perceptions were collected from open-ended questionnaires, which were then coded and analyzed. It was hoped that results could inform a needs analysis for teachers wishing to become more informed about learning disabilities and methods for best teaching these students.

**The Efficacy of Silent Shadowing of Audiobooks on Japanese Second Language Acquisition**  
Michael O. Hora, Hoshi University of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Japan  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/11-1/hora.pdf)

  
ABSTRACT  
This paper presents the findings of a longitudinal pilot study to determine whether an autonomous language program consisting solely of Silent Shadowing Training results in noticeable second language learning gains. To test this hypothesis, the author silently shadowed a Japanese audiobook for 200 hours over six months on his daily commutes to work. Language proficiency was monitored by three videotaped interviews conducted in Japanese: a pre-test taken before beginning shadowing training, an intermediary-test recorded at three months, and a post-test at six months. At the end of the experiment, the author’s Japanese language ability was evaluated by ten native Japanese teachers who viewed the videos and completed an online survey. The results provide preliminary evidence that the silent shadowing of audiobooks during daily commutes can be an effective learning strategy in the development of L2 conversational abilities. Implications for classroom and autonomous language learning programs are also discussed. 

**Aspects of Word Knowledge: An Investigation of the Explicit Exemplification of Aspects of Word Knowledge in a Global Textbook used in South Korea.**  
Ross Sampson, Kanda University of International Studies  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/11-1/sampson.pdf)

ABSTRACT  
The term ‘lexical item’ has proved useful in identifying pieces of language which operate as single units. The extent of knowledge required to master these items is more extensive than many teachers and learners may realise. This study aims to learn whether one specific textbook explicitly addresses the full depth of knowledge in activities for its selected lexical items. A framework was developed to analyse the textbook and each unit was examined with a primary focus on the vocabulary sections. Which knowledge aspects in each activity were being exemplified was determined and a count was taken for each. The results reveal that ‘form and meaning’ clearly dominate attention given in activities. A few other aspects (spoken form, written form, word parts) receive some attention but many receive very little or no attention at all. This study advises that the four learning partners (students, teachers, materials writers and researchers) need to be aware of the lexical impact in language and material writers should explicitly address the depth of lexical item knowledge in textbooks

**What Language-Learning Strategies L2 English Learners Use at a U.S. University Library: An Observational Study**

Jiun-Iung Lei, Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C.  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/10-2/lei.pdf)

ABSTRACT  
Recently, more and more researchers are aware of the need to use qualitative methods for a richer description of the employment of language learning strategies (Griffiths & Oxford, 2014). However, merely a dearth of studies investigated L2 English learners’ strategy use through the qualitative mode—observation. Filling this niche, this study aimed to examine the process of L2 English learners’ strategy use based on an observation. The setting of this study was at the main library of the Indiana University of Pennsylvanian (IUP), which was not only a place for the L2 English learners to study, but also a site where social flows were active. In this productive setting for observation, I took the role of an unobtrusive observer. In order to observe and identify the learners’ strategies, I utilized the Strategy Inventory for Language Learning (Oxford, R. L., 1990) as the observation scheme. Eight emergent themes were coded to describe the learners’ behaviors. Five of them could be categorized with SILL taxonomies, while the other three couldn’t. The integration of the themes led to the argument that the L2 English learners at the library are not just regular patrons, but also active language learning strategy users.   

  
**Inroads to Student Motivation in the Language Classroom: J-Pop**

Adrianne Verla Uchida, Nihon University, Japan  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/10-2/verla_uchida.pdf)

ABSTRACT  
As English is taught as a foreign language in Japan, the issue of whose English should be taught, how it should be taught and by whom are just a few of the questions that educators must decide when implementing a foreign language program. The answers to those questions then often have a direct influence on the learner and how their identity is shaped through learning English. Additionally, integrating pop culture materials that students are familiar with into the EFL classroom is useful as a means of addressing the concept of “cool” and globalization. This paper will review and draw on the ideas of globalization, identity, code switching and performativity - the way in which we perform acts of identity through cultural and social interactions or performance (Pennycook, 2003, p. 528), previously used to research about hip-hop culture in Japanese language and culture while broadening the focus to include Japanese pop (J-pop) and rock music. It will also examine the recent increase of English used in popular Japanese music and attempt to draw conclusions about the reasons why that is, the effects that it has on Japanese culture, especially in determining what is cool, and how it can be utilized in the EFL classroom

**Contrasting Pragmatic Elements of L2 Japanese and L2 English Learning: A Closer Look at Refusals and Indirect Opinions**

Tarin Christopher Griswold, United States Air Force Academy, USA  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/10-2/griswold.pdf)

ABSTRACT  
This paper examines the acquisition of pragmatically correct refusal and indirect opinion strategies by first language (L1) English learners of Japanese, and mirror image pragmatic acquisition of L1 Japanese learners of English. The scholarly evidence seemingly indicates that both L2 learners of English and Japanese can acquire and adopt pragmatically correct refusal and indirect opinion utterances and strategies, either through explicit instruction, or incidentally through target language (TL) immersion environments. Nevertheless, advanced levels of general TL language proficiency do not always appear to correlate to corresponding levels of pragmatic aptitude in the specific areas examined. In fact, pragmatically appropriate speech patterns may often be inconsistently adopted due to a variety of factors, which may point to a greater need for explicit pragmatics instruction in TL classroom environments. 

**The Complexity of Knowing and Serving Japanese Returnees: Issues of Language Maintenance or Attrition**

Gota Hayashi, Tokyo Keizai University, Gakushuin University  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/10-2/hayashi.pdf)

  
ABSTRACT

This paper focuses on how psycholinguistic, educational, and social factors can influence Japanese returnees’ levels of language attrition or maintenance. First, varieties of Japanese returnees from psycholinguistic, educational, and social perspectives are discussed. Second, each factor and its bearing on the attrition/maintenance of their second language is covered. Japanese returnees are diverse in terms of their psycholinguistic profile, making the profiles too diverse to come up with generalizable solutions that work for any returnee. As with the social perspective, the degree of dissonance felt by the returnees differs case by case, and any given event that a returnee may feel discomforted by, may promote a returnee to strive towards maintenance or improvement and another returnee to act in ways that may cause attrition. Provided this complex situation, it is argued that the only possible educational solution to maintenance and attrition is for each returnee to think long term.

**Project-Based EFL Speaking Activity: The English Funfair**

Yustinus Calvin Gai Mali, Universitas Kristen Satya Wacana (Salatiga, Indonesia)  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/10-2/mali.pdf)

ABSTRACT

This paper explicates and justifies activities of the Student English Funfair (SEF) project, a campus event that is used to assess students English as a Foreign Language (EFL) speaking performances in an authentic setting outside the classroom. The paper details pedagogical practices and learning resources deployed in speaking classes. The interactions indicate that the SEF project coupled with Project Based Learning (PBL) provides opportunities for students to apply what they have learned in the classrooms and speak English in an authentic setting. Moreover, the project is a way to make the students practice communication, critical thinking, and creative and collaborative skills. The paper hopes to provide EFL teachers with materials that they can modify and implement in their EFL speaking classes. Further, the paper benefits teachers who need authentic speaking activities that provide opportunities for their students to practice speaking English beyond their classroom walls.

Paul Raine, J. F. Oberlin University  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/10-2/raine.pdf)

  
ABSTRACT  
Sentence translation activities have seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years, with a number of hugely successful language learning websites adopting translation as their pedagogical basis. This paper introduces Sentence Builder, a web-based tool that utilizes the Tatoeba sentence database and Web 2.0 technologies to generate effective and engaging sentence translation tasks. Pedagogical justifications for this tool include the argument that translation itself should be regarded as the fifth macro skill; that translation is highly amenable to gamification; and that the process of contrastive analysis and translation offer numerous benefits to language learners. The paper concludes by arguing that CALL-powered translation-based activities could be effectively exploited by both English language teachers and learners.

  
**Facilitating Cooperative Vocabulary Study with Google Sheets & Quizlet Live**  
Paul McKenna, Tamagawa Gakuen University  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/10-2/mckenna.pdf)

ABSTRACT  
The approach outlined promotes efficient and enjoyable vocabulary study through teamwork and competitive play. A team reading activity is described. Then, students collaborate to identify new vocabulary for further study. Along with definitions and translations, the new vocabulary is recorded on Google Sheets, an online spreadsheet that allows multiple users to edit the same document. Vocabulary flashcards can quickly be created from the spreadsheet using the online application Quizlet, and reviewed immediately via Quizlet Live, a mobile-based team quiz game. Students report high levels of enjoyment, which motivates them to identify new vocabulary for the next iteration of this activity.

  
**A Teacher’s Model of Self-Directed Learning**  
Gota Hayashi, Tokyo Keizai University, Gakushuin University  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/10-2/hayashi2.pdf)

ABSTRACT  
This paper shows how one teacher used technology as a tool to model self-directed learning for his students. This was done so that other teachers can gain ideas and flexibly apply them to their own teaching contexts to motivate students or apply ideas to their own self-directed learning to motivate themselves. Three key points are discussed following an introduction to a shortcoming and the benefits of self-directed learning. They include: (1) constructing a personal self-directed learning plan using PowerPoint, (2) sharing self-directed learning plans as well as progress on self-directed learning on Moodle, and (3) sharing the teacher’s personally selected online resources.

Aytaged Sisay Zeleke, Delaware Technical Community College, USA

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/10-1/Zeleke.pdf)

ABSTRACT

Feedback is one of the most important activities in any English as a Second Language (ESL) writing class, and many teachers and students believe that it is key for writing development. The aim of this paper is to analyze research and come to an understanding of the effectiveness of corrective feedback in enhancing the quality of ESL students’ writing. To this end, the following paper presents a critical review of published empirical studies in the area. The review illustrates that feedback in ESL writing has both advantages and disadvantages, with mixed empirical findings suggesting controversy about its effectiveness. The review concludes by highlighting the need for continuing research in the area.

# **The Motivational Self System, Five-factor Model, and Proficiency in Japanese University Sudents** 

Steven G. B. MacWhinnie, Aomori Chuo Gakuin University, Japan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/10-1/Macwhinnie.pdf)

ABSTRACT

Research has shown that motivation is intimately connected to language proficiency (Dörnyei, 1994), yet little has been done to show how personality might be connected to both personality and proficiency in Japanese undergraduate students. This study examined the connection between the five-factor model of personality traits and the second language (L2) motivational self system, and how both constructs relate to self-perceived proficiency. Participants completed the Ten Item Personality Inventory in Japanese (TIPI-J) along with a measure of the L2 motivational self system. Students from two Japanese universities took part in this study (N = 228). The results showed that extroversion and openness correlated with the L2 motivational self system, while conscientiousness and openness correlated with perceived proficiency.

# **Examining the Role of Model Texts in Writing Instruction** 

John Peloghitis and Dan Ferreira, International Christian University, Japan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/10-1/Peloghitis_Ferreira.pdf)

ABSTRACT

Model texts are a common tool writing teachers utilize to assist students in tackling new, unfamiliar genres. Model texts provide a concrete example for learners to understand what is to be expected as a finished product and to process the rhetorical structures, conventions, and organizational features within the text. By noticing and developing an awareness of rhetorical modes, L2 learners can eventually apply their knowledge more creatively in future writing tasks. The following paper reviews the existing literature concerning the effectiveness and application of model texts in writing. An overview of the advantages and disadvantages in how model texts are implemented˛ highlights some of the pertinent issues related to the teaching and learning practices. Lastly, although scholars have generally advocated the use of models in the literature and have been applied in empirical studies, little has been written which specifically addresses the practical needs of teachers. Thus, this paper offers instructors several guidelines to consider when incorporating model texts into the writing process.

**Five Online Resources for Extensive Listening in the Japanese EFL Classroom** 

Brett Milliner, Tamagawa University, Japan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/9-2/Milliner.pdf)

ABSTRACT

To promote listening fluency and autonomous language learning, lower-intermediate Japanese students were asked to self-select and listen to six listening texts online for homework each week. After each listening, students completed a short listening log to summarise what they listened to and reflect on their listening experience. This paper will introduce the five websites most regularly used by students during the 15-week course. The author hopes that this paper’s theoretical discussion and selection of websites will assist EFL teachers in discerning which online resources would be more appropriate for implementing extensive listening components in their own EFL courses.

**The Positive Influence of Skype Exchanges on Japanese Elementary Students’ Affect**

David Ockert, Toyo University, Japan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/9-2/Ockert.pdf)

ABSTRACT

The pre-post survey results of a pilot / exploratory study of elementary school students in Japan, who engaged in three Skype exchanges with English speakers in Australia, are reported. There are statistically significant increases in Foreign Language Activities (p < .01), International Posture (p < .01), and Motivation toward studying EFL (p < .01), and their Desire to Travel Overseas (p < .05). In addition, the Glass’ delta effect size (Cohen, 1992) measures are: for Foreign Language Activities = 0.83; International Posture =1.06; Motivation to study EFL= 0.80; and Desire to Travel Overseas = 0.54. These results demonstrate the statistically significant increases are also meaningful. The results for statistical power show the level of the probability that the experiment would yield similar results if repeated (Soper, 2016). The Foreign Language Activities result is .77; International Posture is .95, the Motivation’s level is .74, and Desire to Travel Overseas has a .65 level of statistical probability. The effect size results demonstrate the statistically significant increases are meaningful; statistical power results show the probability that the experiment would yield similar results if repeated. These results and the correlations are discussed regarding a future partial least squares regression and structural equation model analysis

**Using Reflective Logs to Track Independent Work**

Malcolm Prentice, Soka University, World Language Centre, Japan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/9-2/Prentice.pdf)

ABSTRACT

This article describes a small Action Research project which looked at the use of reflective statements, submitted online through Google Forms, to track independent reading and listening work done for homework in three introductory English for Academic Purposes (EAP) courses. After accessing the materials (such as graded readers and news articles), students were provided with example narrative frames and asked to submit responses to what they had read (e.g. “After reading this, I realised...”, “This lecture made me want to...”, “My favourite quote was ... because ....”). Analysis of submissions showed that requiring these reflective statements did not deter students from choosing to do additional reading/listening work, but that only a third of statements were of a quality which allowed confidence that students had in fact accessed the materials. Some suggestions are made for how the process can be improved in the future.

Paul Raine, J. F. Oberlin University, Japan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/9-2/Raine.pdf)

ABSTRACT

Apps 4 EFL (www.apps4efl.com) is a Web Based Language Learning (WBLL) platform wholly developed by the author. It uses Creative Commons Data in conjunction with open web technologies to deliver engaging and effective English language learning activities. This paper discusses the types of data utilized by Apps 4 EFL, and gives details about some of the pedagogical activities Apps 4 EFL provides, along with existing research that backs up the effectiveness of such activities. The results of a survey administered to Japanese university students (n=84) are also presented and evaluated. The respondents used the Apps 4 EFL platform for one semester (15 weeks), and the survey was administered at the end of the semester. The respondents used the site to study vocabulary and grammar constructions which related to the content of their respective courses. The results of the survey, along with existing research, suggest that Apps 4 EFL’s activities are effective, enjoyable, and convenient ways for learners to improve their English language abilities.

**Best Practices for Professional Development**

Dan Ferreira, International Christian University, Japan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/9-1/ferreira.pdf)

ABSTRACT

The shift from the industrial-age model of learning to one driven by the global knowledge economy has placed a burden on institutions of higher education to modernize teaching methodology. Although iterations of modern technology continue to mark their presence to varying degrees in learning environments globally, linking the instructional use of modern affordances with enhanced learning outcomes remains an issue. More than ever, research in effective integration points to professional development as the linchpin for success. This essay reviews the latest research and proposes ideas for adapting some of the best practices for professional development today at the individual and institutional levels. 

**Beyond a Transaction: Independent Vocabulary Study Approaches for English Conversation School Students in Japan**

Daniel Hooper, Kanda University of International Studies, Japan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/9-1/hooper.pdf)

ABSTRACT

Despite vocabulary size being widely recognized as a key predictor of L2 reading and listening proficiency, it could be argued that many students within English conversation schools in Japan (eikaiwa) are not given sufficient opportunities for theoretically principled vocabulary study. This paper analyzes existing research on independent study approaches as well as complementary classroom-based pedagogical practices that foster both incidental and deliberate vocabulary learning. Through the utilization of both mobile assisted language learning (MALL) and extensive reading (ER) programs, measured changes to a language course are suggested that could be feasibly implementable within the specific constraints of an eikaiwa setting. Furthermore, potential institutional, technical and affective obstacles that could hamper such a program's effectiveness are identified and discussed. This paper hopes to provide approaches to vocabulary instruction based on empirical data, while also remaining accessible to teachers in a context often overlooked in academic and pedagogical literature.

**Promoting Effort Attributions to EFL Students**

ABSTRACT

Attribution describes an explanation that learners provide for the progress of their second language learning and reasons they attribute to their success or failure in the process of learning a target language. This paper explicates three practical ways to promote effort attributions based in Dornyei’s (2001) motivational teaching framework to the learning process of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students. The explications are elaborated with relevant literature and my reflective learning experiences as a language learner in Indonesia. This paper will be an interest of EFL teachers who are looking for practical ways in enhancing motivation and academic achievements of their students. In essence, this paper encourages constructive collaboration between parents and EFL teachers in taking an active role to promote the effort attributions to students. 

**The Impact of Empathy on Attitudes Towards English in Japanese University Classes**

Paul B. Nadasdy, Tokyo Denki University, Japan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/9-1/nadasdy.pdf)

ABSTRACT

Data were collected from 192 Japanese university students relating to how they interpreted empathy and whether or not the presence of empathy was important in communicative English classes. Furthermore, to get a better understanding of students’ attitudes towards learning English, individuals were asked to give feedback about their studies at junior high school and high school. This was compared to how their attitudes towards English had changed after a year studying communicative English at university. The majority of students reported that it was important for empathy to be present in the learning environment and that their attitudes had changed positively over the course of a year. In addition, questionnaires were distributed relating to how teaching approaches, choice of tasks, and ways of interacting affected levels of empathy between classroom participants. The results from the data suggested that students enjoyed practicing communicating with strangers, enjoyed a range of tasks, and preferred it when teachers recognised them as individuals.

ABSTRACT

The interaction hypothesis states that second language acquisition (SLA) takes place best in an environment where meaning is negotiated between interlocutors using various feedback types.  To add to the body of work in determining whether or not interaction plays a role in SLA, this study examines and analyses the quality of interaction in an information gap activity between two participants – one L1 and one L2 English speaker.  Interesting findings in the data and pedagogical implications are discussed.

**Does Size Matter?: Learners' Self-reported Perceptions in a Small-sized EFL Class**

Min Lun Yeh, Ming Chi University of Technology, Taiwan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/9-1/yeh.pdf)

ABSTRACT

The study focuses on three aspects of EFL learning by identifying learners' self-reported perceptions of learning in a small-sized class compared with their previous experience from a larger class. A questionnaire was administered to 48 college freshman at a technical university in Taiwan. The results show that the participants generally have a positive attitude toward learning English in a small-sized class, finding it more conducive to learning, particularly appreciating the immediacy of error correction such a setting provides. Finally, the study explores the areas participants perceived to improve the most in a small class setting: oral communication ability, pronunciation, and listening, respectively.

ABSTRACT

This paper reports on findings from an investigation into the reason why 50 Vietnamese adult EFL learners have made so many pronunciation errors, particularly suprasegmental errors. The data of this qualitative research study provides evidence that pronunciation instruction was focused on individual sounds (segmentals) and tended to overlook suprasegmetals. Additionally, the study shows that lack of exposure to foreigners, both inside and outside the classroom, is one of the main factors in determining the participants’ pronunciation errors.

**What Teachers Can Do in the Pedagogical Trinity: Pragmatics, Grammar, and Communicative Language Teaching**

Sanae Oda-Sheehan, Ochanomizu University, Tokyo

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/8-2/oda-sheehan.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
While pragmatic awareness plays a vital role in developing communicative competence, it is less likely to be addressed in the Japanese EFL classroom partly due to lower pragmatic awareness among teachers. In fact, many cases of pragmatic failure are related to deficiencies of adequate teaching, which need to be urgently addressed in order to prevent learners from making unintentional mistakes. Towards that end, this study explores possible paths to promote pragmatic pedagogy and proposes one feasible approach, fully utilizing what is already available in the classroom – the integration of pragmatics and grammar pedagogy. Although grammar-oriented approaches are often cited as one of the causes for ineffective EFL learning, this integration can benefit the classroom where teachers need to satisfy various demands such as implementation of communicative language teaching (CLT) and preparation for college entrance exams. This approach will have great significance for teachers who struggle to balance those needs, especially for Japanese teachers of English (JTEs), many of whom believe that their strength is more likely to lie in their grammatical competence. The implications of this study may lead to more holistic approaches to L2 pragmatics with new teaching perceptions in the demanding EFL classroom.

This paper attempts to show the necessary ideas that need to be understood when making good decisions about English education in an EFL environment.

**The Effect of Popular American Films on Taiwanese University EFL Students' Perceptions of L2 Culture**  
Morgan William Dooley, Ming Chuan University

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/8-2/dooley.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
Film has been used for many university-level courses in Taiwan. Extant research, though, is limited regarding how this specific form of visual media may affect EFL students’ understanding of foreign or L2 culture. Hence, the purpose of this research is to discover if using this authentic material has significant impact on students’ L2 cultural learning. The 52 student participants were enrolled in a junior-level course at a northern Taiwan university. They first completed a quantitative attitudinal pre-test with Likert-type questions at the very beginning of the semester. After two months of instruction, the posttest identical to the pre-test was administered. Next, SPSS software was used to obtain the bivariate statistical data with t-tests for comparative analysis. Final results proved overall that popular American films affect participants’ L2 culture learning. These results provide EFL educators with an effective option for teaching this subject. In addition to providing the effective aspects of this approach, there are suggestions regarding how to manage some ineffective ones.

**Behind Japanese Students’ Silence in English Classrooms**  
Sachie Banks, Bunkyo University, Japan

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/8-2/banks.pdf)

Abstract:  
This ethnographic study investigated what challenges Japanese university students faced in communicating in English with their teachers. The study focused on the functions of student-teacher interaction in English as a foreign language (EFL) contexts in Japan. Participant observations were conducted during two English classes and further data was collected from four students through semi-structured interviews. The study revealed three factors that could have interrupted student-teacher interaction: a collective communication system created by students, respect for their teacher and peers, and students’ higher expectations of what they should say. Academic support for teaching cultural differences in educational settings and encouraging students to speak up individually should contribute to communicative strengths in the classroom and wider intercultural situations.

Anna Husson Isozaki, Juntendo University

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/8-2/isozaki.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
Evidence has been accumulating regarding the specific challenges for reaching fluency in reading L2 English, particularly in EFL settings. Some interventions are showing potential value, according to recent cognitive and classroom research. Among these are incorporating multimedia, especially audio to make use of evidence of phonology’s facilitative role in building L2 reading, and also incorporating collaborative reading work in the classroom. This paper briefly reviews relevant research and develops an integrated skills approach to a proposed pedagogical intervention for university learners. Designed to collect qualitative and empirical data, this proposed action research is intended to explore and help clarify if integrating support for phonological awareness in collaborative classroom settings can improve EFL literacy experiences and acquisition for learners.

ELT professionals are therefore often concerned with creating scenarios where L2 interaction is being fostered. The purpose of this study was to investigate how differences in interlocutor can influence the amount and nature of interaction occurring within a communicative task. Utilizing a conversational analysis (CA) methodology, this study analyses conversation strings from two (student-student and teacher-student) dyads recorded during a picture dictation task. Transcriptions of the recorded data highlighted differences between the two dyads in the patterns of interaction that occurred. Interaction in the student-student data featured a higher amount of repair initiation sequences and conversation strategies than was found in the teacher-student group. Furthermore, whereas next turn repair initiation (NTRI) was frequent in the student-student dyad, repair initiation was significantly delayed in the teacher-student data. Potentially problematic examples of teacher talk were also identified from the teacher-student transcription. The results suggested that an expert-novice orientation in the teacher-student dyad may have created psychological constraints limiting the amount and type of interaction that occurred. This study provides further evidence of both the importance of peer interaction and the necessity for reflective inquiry in teachers’ professional development.

**The Global Academic Vocabulary Lexicon:** **A New ELT Resource**  
Paul Wadden, International Christian University; Dan Ferreira, International Christian University; Edward Rush, Trinity College, University of Melbourne

Abstract:  
This article describes the Global Academic Vocabulary (GAV) lexicon, lessons, and platform that was initially implemented at International Christian University in Tokyo and is now under significant further development at the University of Melbourne and NYU-Tokyo. Research by Na and Nation has shown that understanding of about 95% of the words in an academic text is required for learners to confidently comprehend its meaning. But exactly what words do university learners need to know to achieve such a level of coverage? The GAV provides one important answer to this question by combining the headwords from the three most significant long-standing corpus-based vocabulary studies to date: the University Word List (UWL), the Academic Word List (AWL), and the English for Academic Purposes (EAP) word lists, with a fourth, the New Academic Word List (NAWL), now being added. This article provides the rationale behind the creation of the GAV.

**Metalanguage as a Component of the Communicative Classroom**  
Michael Jonathan Ellis, International Christian University High School

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/8-2/ellis.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
In this paper, the author reviews research on the use of metalanguage in language education to suggest that metalanguage has productive uses in communicative language teaching (CLT). First, there is an exploration of definitions which begins by borrowing Berry’s (2005) notion of metalanguage as an imprecise concept, indistinct from the target language. Then, the relevant aspects of SLA theory including metalinguistic knowledge, meaning-focus and focus on form, implicit and explicit knowledge, and languaging are explored to frame the potential utility of metalanguage. Finally, a summary of research on metalanguage is provided, followed by a discussion of conclusions. The findings indicate that metalanguage can be used productively in CLT if proper consideration is taken for students’ varied metalinguistic backgrounds and target language proficiency. Furthermore, written tasks with a goal of passive metalinguistic knowledge seemed to be better suited for metalinguistic instruction. In addition to its use during class time, metalanguage may be considered a learning strategy which leads to increased learner autonomy.

**An Introduction to Flipped Learning**

Selinda England, Showa Women’s University  
  
Abstract:

Flipped Learning is a new, profound teaching philosophy, encouraging teachers to approach their classes in a modern way. Instead of the traditional, lecture-style format, educators use technology to become the “guide on the side”, tutoring students with hands-on activities. Classrooms which utilize Flipped Learning give students the power to learn independently, at home, while encouraging dynamic group discussions in class. (Sharples et al., 2014). In addition to an overview of the Flipped Classroom Method, this article will showcase several key technology tools to aid in instruction, for example, a) Movenote, b) Screencast-o-matic and c) QR codes.

**Using Smartphones in the Language Classroom: Making the Most of Core Smartphone Apps**

Brett Milliner, Tamagawa University  
  
Abstract:  
Smartphones, tablets, and touch screen laptops, are powerful tools capable of accommodating hundreds of specialized, complex operations and applications to anyone, seemingly anywhere in the world. As close to all tertiary students own and/or have access to one of these devices, it is natural for language teachers to be interested in how these devices can be used to leverage the language learning process. This short paper considers some of the built-in, core applications or “apps” which come with smartphones when they are unboxed. The potential uses for voice recorders, video cameras, timers and digital cameras in the language classroom will all be presented in an effort to stress the importance and value of these language-learning tools.

**Learning through Watching: How to Use Movieclips.com as an Effective Learning Tool**

Michelangelo Magasic, Tamagawa Universtiy  
  
Abstract:  
This paper describes ways in which streaming video may be used as an effective learning tool. After outlining the utility of streaming video as a technology for L2 language learning, this paper provides two separate techniques through which streaming video might be employed in the classroom. The first way is a general viewing strategy through which students may familiarise themselves with new vocabulary and build confidence in foreign language media while the second method involves using the search function inherent to streaming video to find topical clips to help teach specific vocabulary or grammar points.

**Using a Tablet Computer for Positive Self-review**  
David Ockert, Toyo Universtiy  
  
Abstract:  
This paper reports the results of a small, exploratory, and longitudinal study which tested for the influence of video recording of students successfully speaking in the classroom and self-viewing with an iPad at a later date. The iPad video intervention, which allowed some of the students to view their successful use of English while speaking in front of their peers, is arguably a form of Positive Self Review (PSR; Dowrick, 1977). The results show that the students who received the iPad intervention had a non-statistically significant higher level of amotivation; statistically significant higher levels for the two most extrinsic motives (p < .05), including a higher level of the identified regulation items (Ideal L2 Selves; p < .10); and a statistically significant (p < .01) higher level for all three of the intrinsic motives: for knowledge, for stimulation, and for feelings of accomplishment. These results support Dörnyei’s L2 Motivational Self-System theory (2005, 2009). Finally, these results indicate that PSR may support student motivation for successful long term acquisition of EFL.

**Automatic Monitoring of Quick-Types: A Tool to** **Visualise Progress and Detect Cheating**

Malc Prentice, Soka University, World Languages Centre  
  
Abstract:  
Quick-writes are a useful activity for increasing students' writing fluency. For those who need to take typed exams such as the TOEFL iBT, or use computers in the future for other tasks, a useful variation on this is the quick-type. However, when students are producing hundreds of pieces of writing on a variety of topics each week, it becomes difficult to monitor progress and detect cheating. This paper describes an open-source, cross-platform tool (created initially in response to student self-plagiarism) which analyses quick-types submitted by students via a Google Form and produces two reports: an easily interpreted visual overview of progress for students, and a summary report for teachers which flags possible problems for attention.

**Text and Corpora: Collocations, Constraints, and the Classroom**

Roy Randy Y. Briones, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom  
  
Abstract:  
This paper attempts to demonstrate collocation from a disaster-report article and how certain constraints in word-combinations influence collocability. These constraints are identified using corpus data followed by an enumeration of practical means of demonstrating these constraints vis-a-vis the teaching of vocabulary in the classroom. To achieve these, a 491-word online disaster-report on Typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan was selected. From this article, 13 nodes (words) and their corresponding collocates were identified to form a Semantic Field or node-collocate combination. Two fixed expressions were also identified from the said article. In order to identify the constraints that influence how words collocate or combine with other words, the following verbs from the above-mentioned Semantic Field were identified, “lash”, “struck”, “knocked out”, “ripped”, as well as the fixed expressions: “in the wake of” and “faced with a scenario”. Using Carter’s (1998) constraints on word-combinations in English, the relevant constraints on word-combinations of the above verbs and fixed expressions were identified using corpus data from the following corpora: ICE – Philippines, ICE – New Zealand, and the Brown Corpus. Lastly, upon identification of the constraints vis-à-vis the use of corpus data, ways on how teachers can demonstrate these word combination constraints in the classroom were presented.

**The Preference of Learning With Various Authentic Materials on an E-Platform: A Survey on Advanced-Level Students**

Min Lun Yeh, Ming Chi University of Technology, Taiwan  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/7-2/lun_yeh.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
Numerous academic findings have shown that authenticity engages students in learning languages. Also, language learners have relied on authentic materials as evidenced in much research. The purpose of this paper is to determine the viability of applying authentic materials to an e-learning platform by collecting quantitative information from a questionnaire surveying 77 freshmen students at a technology university in Taiwan. These students were placed at an advanced level. They were exposed to various kinds of authentic materials in the one-year Freshmen English class. By the end of the school year, they were asked to fill out a Likert-scale questionnaire concerning their attitude toward the authenticity presented in the class. The findings are intended to illuminate the effectiveness of authentic materials in an e-learning platform.  
  
**NNESTs on the Rise: Learning and Teaching of L2 Pragmatics**  
Akiko Chiba, The Open University of Hong Kong  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/7-2/chiba.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
It has been a widely accepted perception that only the native-language teachers can teach the authentic language form, whereas nonnative-language teachers are considered as second class professionals (Mahboob, 2004; Brain, 2010; Kumaravadivelu, 2012); the so called “native speaker fallacy” (Phillipson, 1992). With such preference to native teachers still being prominent on one hand, the population of nonnative English-speaking teachers (NNESTs) today outnumbers its counterpart on the other (Kahmi-Stein, 2004). Although the benefit of the local NNESTs are somewhat recognized (Medgyes, 1999; Mahboob, 2004), the favoritism toward native teachers seems to be deep-rooted (Mahboob, 2004; Braine, 2010). This phenomenon brings about several disadvantages to nonnative-language teachers, such as limited employment opportunities and difficulties in teaching areas such as pronunciation and culture, which can lead to diminishing confidence as language-teaching professionals altogether. Despite this undesirable circumstance, research on instructional pragmatics, which specifically targets the needs of nonnative English-speaking teachers, is rather scarce. Thus, this paper examines how NNESTs can be empowered to teach the target community pragmatics, by investigating NNESTs’ challenges in learning and teaching the target community pragmatics, and secondly, by exploring means to overcome some of the disadvantages that hinder NNESTs as English language professionals.  
  
**The Effects of Journaling on Taiwanese EFL Students’ Extensive Reading Habits and Attitudes**  
Keith M. Graham  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/7-2/Graham.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
This research study examines the effects of journaling on the extensive reading habits and attitudes of Taiwanese English as a foreign language (EFL) students. The study was conducted with eleven eighth grade students enrolled in a private junior high school in northern Taiwan. Students were asked to submit weekly journal letters online to their teacher about English novels read outside of class. The teacher responded with comments and questions. Data from the study show that using journaling as an activity increased the amount of extensive reading done in English as well as improved many students’ attitudes toward extensive reading.  
  
**Teachers’ and Students’ Perceptions of Team-Teaching Practices in Two Japanese Senior High Schools**  
Takaaki Hiratsuka, University of the Ryukyus  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/7-2/hiratsuka.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
In this study I explored the perceptions of local Japanese teachers of English (JTEs), foreign assistant language teachers (ALTs) and their students of team-teaching practices in language classrooms in Japan. Data were collected from two pairs of team teachers and four of their students in two Japanese senior high schools through multiple qualitative methods, including interviews, pair discussions and focus group discussions. Findings suggest that the teachers and students considered team-teaching practices to be: unique, because of the participation of a native English speaker in the team, and also because of the particular nature of teamwork by both teachers; open-ended, due to vague definitions; and less important than other commitments at school. It is noteworthy that the participants had these perceptions with different degrees (from very strong to very weak) and with various, sometimes opposing, attitudes (from very positive to very negative). These participants’ complex perceptions derived from their personal experiences, contextual factors and research conditions.  
  
**Pedagogical Implications of Discourse Analysis: One-on-one Teacher-student Interaction in a Second Language Preschool Class**  
Anna Belobrovy, Bunkyo Gakuin University  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/7-2/belobrovy.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
The study connects two areas of language research: discourse analysis and second language pedagogy. The overall goal of this study is to raise young learners’ language teachers’ awareness on how to improve the quality of classroom talk in order to make it more comprehensible to students. As professional development is a long process, in this study I will only introduce three techniques language teachers of young children can explore in order to achieve a more comprehensive and engaging language classroom without having to give up natural speech. The language activity chosen for analysis is based on the content-based theory, which allows connecting drawing with language learning in the international preschool context. In the activity described in this research, students were engaged in one-on-one conversations with teachers and answered their questions to show comprehension. Two teachers’ interaction patterns were tested in terms of repetitiveness, turn-distribution and reference to the information provided by students. Based on my findings, I recommend three tools language teachers can utilize to modify their interaction style and enhance students’ comprehension: systematically repeat key words provided by students, create opportunities for students to initiate conversation and use reiteration to emphasize grammatical patterns. With this study, I hope to open new doors in the field of preschool language acquisition in Japan and encourage more researchers to support second language educators of that age group.

**A Study on the Relationship of English Listening Comprehension to Linguistic, Cognitive and Affective Variables among Taiwanese Elementary School Students**

Wei-Chen Chen and Wen-Ying Lin, University of Taipei, Taiwan  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/7-1/chen_lin.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
The present study intended to take a close look at the relationship of Taiwanese young learners’ English listening comprehension to three clusters of variables —linguistic (general English proficiency and English vocabulary knowledge), cognitive, (Chinese listening ability and metacognitive awareness), and affective (English listening anxiety and language learning motivation). The participants of the present study were 141 sixth graders from two schools in Taipei City and New Taipei City. The instruments used in this study were: (1) an English listening comprehension test, (2) an English proficiency test, (3) a Chinese listening comprehension test, (4) an English vocabulary test, (5) a metacognitive awareness questionnaire, (6) an FL listening anxiety scale, and (7) a motivation questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed mainly through multiple regression analysis procedures. The major findings were summarized as follows. First, the three clusters of variables together significantly contributed to English listening comprehension (_R__2_ = .39, _F_(6, 134) = 14.15, _p_ < .001). Second, the cognitive variables significantly provided a unique (9%) explained variance (_R__2__change_ \= .09, _F__change_(2,136) = 7.76, _p_ < .01) in English listening performance after the affective variables had been accounted for. Finally, the linguistic variables also significantly provided an additional (18%) explained variance (_R__2__change_ \= .18, _F__change_(2,134) = 19.44, _p_ < .001) in English listening performance over and beyond the prediction afforded by the affective and cognitive variables. Based on the findings of the present study, some implications and recommendations for future research were provided.

**The Impact of Globalization on Language Education Policies in Japan and South Korea**

Allen Lindskoog, Chuo University, Tokyo

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/6-2/lindskoog.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
The impact of Globalization on English language education policies has been felt throughout East Asia. The impact effects language learning, policy decisions, curriculum development, and teaching (Nunan, 2003). The common theme from nearly all East Asian countries’ educational ministries and governmental institutions is the discourse of globalization – with linguistic capital a country can be competitive in the global economy. This paper examines the discourse surrounding globalization and English language by comparing South Korea and Japan and how the impact of globalization has impacted English language policies and practices on these two countries.  
  
**Reconsidering the Noticing Hypothesis**  
Taeko Doi, Globist English School

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/6-2/doi.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
In acquiring second language speaking skills, the Noticing Hypothesis claims that the learners need to notice the gap between what learners can say in their inter-language and what they want to say in the target language. This paper deals with three questions which arose from my teaching practice about the hypothesis: At what point during the time of articulation does noticing occur? What conditions allow the learners to notice the gap? Are there any unnoticeable formal elements? The review of the literature shows that learners can notice the gap only when they have sufficient grammar knowledge, enough time to monitor their production, and the intention to review their own production. Second, while phonological and morphological errors are easily noticed, major structures of the utterance are unable to be noticed and are not restructured. Third, content words are more easily attended to than function words. Finally, exactly when the noticing can occur in one articulation is left unmentioned in the Noticing Hypothesis, namely at the onset or in the middle of or after the articulation. Based on these findings it can be concluded that noticing can occur only under certain conditions.  
  
**Japanese EFL Learners’ Perceptions of English as an International Language: The Gap between the Societal Demands and the Classroom Realities**  
Chie Nishimura, Koka-gakuen Junior and Senior High School, Tokyo

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/6-2/nishimura.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
Although EFL learners are now being exposed to various types of English that are used in actual international communication, students of EFL in Japan have not yet been widely exposed to concepts such as EIL (English as an International Language), World Englishes, and Globish. This is due to the fact that in English Language Teaching in Japan, there seems to remain a preference for English spoken by native-speakers, and a lack of awareness amongst students as well as teachers of how diverse the English language really is. Currently, EFL learning contexts in Japan do not necessarily expose learners to the type of English that is recognized at the societal level as a tool for international communication. In this article, I explore Japanese EFL learners' perceptions of English, and address several problems in Japanese classrooms with respect to reconciling the gap between English as a tool for international communication and English as an academic subject. I conclude with suggestions on how to close the gap between societal demands and the realities that exist in Japanese schools.

Abstract:  
This longitudinal study is designed to provide an orderly account of how beliefs about English language learning change among seven high school students in Japan. Beginning when the students were first-year high school students (10th graders), the investigation takes a qualitative multiple-case-study approach that includes in-depth interviews, responses to open-ended questions, and written reports. Data gathering ended when each student, in the third year of high school, chose a university. Conclusions include: (1) factors that influence changes in learners’ beliefs and (2) implications for teachers and educators.

**The Effect of an Unequal Power Relationship on Interaction in a Children's EFL Classroom**

Abigail Odakura, International Christian University High School, Tokyo

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/6-1/odakura.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
Although children are often thought to have an advantage when it comes to second language acquisition, in EFL contexts, adults tend to learn more quickly due to experience and socialization (Ortega, 2009). In order to facilitate communication in a children’s EFL classroom, it is important for teachers to recognize the strategies that children use to when they want to indicate difficulties in interaction. This paper uses Conversation Analysis to examine the strategy use of three children and the power relations between the children and the adult teacher in a children’s conversation class in Tokyo.  
  
**Information Technology in English Language Learning: Towards a Plan in Teacher Professional Development and Growth**  
Phillip A. Towndrow, Centre for Research and Practice, National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technical University, Singapore

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/6-1/towndrow.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
The use of Information Technology (IT) in English language learning has grown over the past 50 years in response to learners’ needs and developments in theories relating to the nature of language and language learning. But technological advancement is not neutral. Educational practitioners require ways of determining what IT has to offer and justifying their decisions to utilise it. Using an original lesson outline and instructional aids produced for a primary level (age 9 and above) class in Singapore, this paper illustrates how IT has the potential to create learning opportunities, increase the quality of learning experiences and provide a basis for input variation. The article concludes with four ideas for starting and maintaining a programme of language teacher professional development and growth with IT. Considered individually, each of these items can bring small rewards. But when combined they have the potential to generate more ambitious and transformative action plans.  
  
**Language Learner Identities: Utilizing Conversation Analysis in the Classroom**  
Reiko Takeda, International Christian University, Tokyo

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/6-1/takeda.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
Conversation Analysis (CA), a method which studies and analyzes interaction has been used to study organizational structures of utterances, such as turn-taking, sequencing and repair practices. However, an area which is attracting attention is CA studies in the English language classroom, in particular, identities of language learners. Through examples of CA studies of interactions involving English language learners, the article discusses how using CA to analyze interactions in English language classroom can help address pedagogical issues surrounding the emergence of asymmetrical learner identities. The article concludes with the need to make CA available for more English language teachers as a vehicle to understand their students and their potential.  
  
**Extending Learning Opportunities: Diverging from the IRF to Promote Collaborative Pedagogy**  
Mikiko Sudo, International Christian University, Tokyo

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/6-1/sudo.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
The IRF/RE (initiation-response-feedback/initiation-response-evaluation) is a well-known pedagogical device to control participation structures in instructional settings; however, teachers interested in promoting students’ autonomy distance themselves from overusing this device. One of the main reasons is that students in the IRF oriented interactions are, in principle, “invited to participate …, but they are not authorized to question what they are accomplishing or why” (Kinginger, 2002, p. 255). In spite of such a serious drawback, many teachers still stay unconscious about how they heavily rely on the IRF in their classrooms. This paper reviews studies that have explored teachers' efforts to break the IRF sequence. By so doing the author illustrates how teachers’ conscious shift from authoritative discourse successfully promoted collaborative pedagogy and increased students’ learning opportunities.  
  
**Vocabulary Acquisition through Extensive Reading**  
Fumiko Sato, Tokyo Women's Christian University

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/6-1/sato.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
Vocabulary acquisition through extensive reading is significant and should be treated with substantial concern. Learning the usage and meaning of words incidentally in their contexts and developing inferencing skill to understand unknown words during extensive reading is a powerful contributor to vocabulary growth. Research showing that incidental vocabulary acquisition through extensive reading and intentional vocabulary instruction are not mutually exclusive, but are complementary. Various strategies for intentional vocabulary acquisition may compensate for the weaknesses and enhance the advantages of incidental vocabulary acquisition through extensive reading in EFL situations.  
  
**East Asian Students' Autonomy in EFL Classrooms**  
Sachiko Maruoka

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/6-1/maruoka.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
East Asian countries have shifted the pedagogical focus of English education from grammatical components to developing communicative skills in English and positive attitudes towards engaging in proactive communication as a responsible member of a community, both of which can be components in learner autonomy. However, such shifts can not necessarily be found in the reality of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classrooms. This paper explores the extent to which East Asian students can be autonomous in EFL classes, and if the gap between the education policies and the reality of EFL education in East Asia can be closed by promoting learner autonomy through certain types of activities, specifically cooperative learning (CL). The paper concludes that reactive autonomy, which is proposed by Littlewood (1999), is congruent with East Asian students, and that CL has potential to promote the students’ autonomy and to accomplish Japanese education policies focusing on communicative proficiency in EFL classrooms.

Although the JET (Japan Exchange and Teaching) Programme and its Assistant Language Teachers (ALTs) have existed for more than a quarter century, many questions on how and to what extent ALTs ought to be utilized in the classroom still remain. Present research is largely concerned with discussions of cultural differences that impede successful team-teaching, or documentation of issues, such as ALT underutilization, rather than offering tangible solutions or program evaluation. Examining the teaching beliefs and attitudes toward student motivation of both ALTs and their Japanese counterparts (JTEs) is one possible step towards practical solutions to these issues. This paper outlines the results of a survey on the importance of motivational strategies given to ALTs and JTEs while providing concrete suggestions for how to better utilize ALTs in the way that draws from the common beliefs uncovered.

Applying the Findings of Attribution Theory-Related Research to the College Foreign Language Classroom  
Guy Smith, Tokyo Women's Christian University  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/5-2/smith.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
In this paper, the author first discusses how attributions, in general, play a role in student motivation regarding effort when attempting tasks and in coming to decisions of whether to continue or discontinue those efforts. In particular, the focus is on the context of Japanese EFL learners and their low self-esteem as competent language learners and users. The importance of enabling such students to gain a clear point of reference regarding their own personal progress and improvement, and the implications this has for their self-perception as successful and competent second language learners is explored through an action research project.  
  
Computer-Mediated Communicative Competence: How Email Facilitates Second-Language Learning  
Matthew Klaus, Tamagawa Gakuen First-Division, Tokyo  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/5-2/klaus.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
Computer-mediated communication (CMC) is an important medium by which teachers and students interact both inside and outside of the classroom. Unfortunately, CMC has received little attention in terms of second-language (L2) acquisition. This paper reviews a variety of recent research on CMC’s role in language teaching to provide a basis for understanding how the medium can aid L2 teaching and learning. The review shows that CMC’s role in L2 teaching is effective when the process is blended with explicit instruction and autonomous practice. However, this paper also illustrates how L2 learners lack pragmatic competence when using CMC that results in misunderstandings when student-to-teacher or native-to-non-native interaction occurred. The review concludes with pedagogical considerations for L2 teaching and learning.

Emphasizing Content in the English Composition Classroom in Japan

Jonathan Brown, University of Yamanashi, Kofu  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/5-1/brown.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
This paper attempts to briefly explain why an overemphasis of grammar and vocabulary in the writing classroom is ineffective at building ESL students’ writing abilities beyond the basic level and how an emphasis on content can help to improve these writing abilities.  Several exercises taken from an actual English writing textbook used in Japanese high schools will be used to 1) demonstrate how grammar and vocabulary is the predominant focus in the English composition classroom in Japan, and 2) how easily an instructor might integrate content into the writing exercises without needing to make large changes or restructure the curriculum.  
  
Searching for a New Approach to Listening  
Matthew P. Wallace, Kanto International High School, Tokyo  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/5-1/wallace.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
Listening is an essential skill for learners to develop as they acquire a new language. Unfortunately, it has received little attention in the language classroom and language learning literature. This article reviews the current literature on second language listening skill development. Evidence from the review indicates the current approach to pedagogical listening is inadequate in addressing the needs of second language learners. As a result, an eclectic approach, combining the current approach and the process approach is proposed. The review concludes with pedagogical implications for the language listening classroom.

Issues in Second Language Listening Comprehension and the Pedagogical Implications  
Tomoko Kurita, Teachers College, Columbia University, Tokyo  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/5-1/kurita.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
Listening is an important language skill to develop in terms of second language acquisition (SLA). In spite of its importance, second language (L2) learners often regard listening as the most difficult language skill to learn. This paper reviews a variety of recent research on listening comprehension to provide a basis for creating more effective listening instruction. It begins with a brief discussion of listening processes for comprehension and acquisition, followed by reviewing cognitive research, linguistic research and affective research on listening comprehension, and discusses implications of teaching L2 listening for comprehension and acquisition. The paper concludes that current research on listening comprehension has revealed the importance of metacognitive knowledge, lexical knowledge and prosodic cues including stress and intonation as well as reducing anxiety in the development listening comprehension.  
  
EFL Journal Writing: An Exploratory Study in Self-expression as a Bridge for Creative Writing  
Asako Takaesu, International Christian University, Tokyo  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/5-1/takaesu.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
This study examines how reflective journal writing affected college students in a creative writing course and explores key factors to ensure a successful journal writing process. The qualitative data analysis based on students’ journal entries and three surveys administered over the course of nine weeks indicate that the activity allowed students to deepen their self-awareness, served as a springboard for more elaborate creative pieces they later pursued, changed their attitude toward writing in English and enhanced their confidence, and increased their motivation for more challenging writing tasks. Trying to create an environment where students feel unthreatened by overly strict academic writing rules and having them keep a journal on a regular basis appear to play key roles in promoting a successful journal writing process.   
  
Applying SLA Research and Theory to Practice: Cooperative Output-focused Activities for an EFL Reading Classroom in Japan  
Miyoko Okazaki, Aoyama Gakuin University, Tokyo  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/5-1/okazaki.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
The intent of this article is to encourage English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers to experiment with the practical application from second language acquisition (SLA) research and theory by sharing ideas for classroom activities. The activities proposed are for classroom teachers to incorporate some aspects of SLA research and theory in a communicative classroom. The article begins by reviewing the important SLA research and theory related to noticing, output, and interaction, followed by the current trend of effective pedagogical approaches and how they relate to the research and theory. Then the article discusses key common challenges in teaching English in Japan. Finally, activities for an EFL reading classroom with applying the described research and theory are presented. The activities attempt to encourage cooperative output-focused activities for EFL reading classrooms in Japan.    
  
The Effectiveness of Shadowing on Students' Psychology in Language Learning  
Kazuko Shiota, Sophia University, Tokyo  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/5-1/shiota.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of shadowing on English skills, but few have investigated its impact on learners' emotions. This study looks at how shadowing affects novice college students' psychology, which is typically low on intrinsic motivation in the Grammar-Translation Method and high on anxiety in the Communicative Approach. Data collected suggests that shadowing could be a useful technique to solve problems in students' attitudes towards second language learning.

Autonomy Enhancing Tools for Teacher Development

Jackie Suginaga, Komazawa Women’s University  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/4-2/suginaga.pdf)  
  
Abstract:      
Recent literature advocates that teacher education is most effective when it adopts a multi-perspective approach to teaching and learning through Reflective Practices, Action research, and Exploratory Practice. The meta-cognitive strategies developed through self-reflection can allow teachers to grow on professional as well as personal levels. In order for the teacher to foster autonomous learning, they must reflect on their own teaching and learning practices. This paper considers how teachers as learners can engage in this transformative process by infusing a blend of theoretical and practical dimensions of Reflective Practices which needs little time to implement yet brings a wealth of rewards to both teachers and their learners.   
  
  
Use of Corrective Feedback in the Classroom: A Reflective Analysis  
Ethan Taomae, Teachers College Columbia University, Tokyo  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/4-2/taomae.pdf)  
  
Abstract  
Corrective feedback from teachers is an important part of the process of second language acquisition. Therefore teachers need to be aware of how they are providing feedback and how their students perceive it. In this study, the author used CA methodology to analyze how corrective feedback was provided in his class and found that recasts were the predominant form of correction. The analysis showed that recasts were effective when its purpose was salient to the student. However, recasts were often used as confirmation checks and this created an ambiguity which prevented the student from recognizing it as corrective feedback. An unexpected finding and one that showed the benefits of self-reflection was the realization of this author’s use of foreigner talk while providing corrective feedback.  
  
  
Language Shift and Revitalization  
Peter Cassidy, Mitsui Gardens International Preschool (American Embassy Housing Compound, Tokyo)  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/4-2/cassidy.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
The global spread of English has forced many cultures to adapt their language domain repertoires, and this language shift, in a worst-case scenario, can result in the death of a language, a change in cultural identity, and the loss of a cultural artifact. Organizations promoting the respect for local languages and the implementation of language revitalization strategies have many hindering factors to consider and the existence of linguistic feudalism and Darwinism lessens the effectiveness of certain programs hoping to revitalize local languages around the globe. Said attitudes about the relevance of a language, the language itself, the number of speakers, the medium for language acquisition and the availability of resources for promoting language acquisition all factor into the equation of language shift. Success stories are rare, but through planning and policy, formal education programs and community-based programs, local languages have a real chance of increasing certain domains of use.  
  
The Role of Phonological Memory and Vocabulary in Second Language Acquisition  
Arthur Nguyen, Teachers College, Columbia University, Tokyo  
[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/4-2/nguyen.pdf)  
  
Abstract:  
Vocabulary has long been an under-utilized aspect in English L2 instruction.  However, numerous studies have argued that vocabulary is a critical part of second language acquisition. This paper will argue this point, as well as explore how the mind processes and retains vocabulary.  A handful of case studies will be explored to better understand this link and show how pedagogical strategies can be created to help aid students in successfully learning and retaining vocabulary.

**Newspaper Subjectivity from Multimodal Perspectives**

Makoto Sakai, University of Birmingham, U.K. 

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/4-1/sakai.pdf)

Abstract:  
The author argues for the need to examine how the secondary mode (visuals) in newspaper reports functions and affects the overall nature of the medium, and what interpersonal relationship such text is trying to establish with readers. In this information age, a considerable amount of information people are exposed to has multi-modal structures, and as new technologies appear on the marketplace and quickly blend into people’s daily lives, literacy requirements change (Luke, 2000). Acquiring necessary “multi-modal literacy” (Unsworth, 2001) to take critical viewpoints toward the information not only in the linguistic mode but also in other modes is then very important.

Abstract:  
This study evaluates practical phonological competence in Japanese native speakers (JNS) at the first and second year college level in terms of production and recognition of second language (L2) phones. Methodology in the first part of the study involves 100 JNS listeners attempting to differentiate and identify L2 phones produced by an English native speaker (ENS) in 1 and 2 syllable words. In the second part of the study, the same words are produced on videotape by a group of 5 JNS readers for 2 ENS groups: 23 residents of Japan and 31 U.S. residents. Results from this learner group indicate a consistent pattern of significant deficiencies in the ability to produce and recognize L2 phones.

**Student Use of Japanese in the EFL Classroom**

Jennifer Yphantides, Kanda University of International Studies

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/3-2/yphantides.pdf)

Abstract:  
This paper attempts to address the issue of first language (L1) use in the English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom in the Japanese context. Although many may assume that Japan is rather homogeneous, the face of this country is gradually changing and the ramifications of this shift can be felt in the classroom. As a result, the author chose to carry out this action research project at a major high school in the center of Tokyo where not all students shared the same L1. The paper examines patterns of L1 use and the reasons for which students were reverting to their mother tongue.

Abstract:  
This study explores the feasibility and effectiveness of applying the concepts of conversational implicature and adjacency pairs to the teaching of listening. The intention was to help students understand short conversations in the Listening Section Part A of TOEFL ITP in the test preparatory class in a Japanese high school. Three lessons applying conversation analysis were designed and implemented to introduce the particular features of a basic unit of conversation and ways to find a speaker’s primary intention concealed under the literal or surface meaning. The results indicate that the strategy　instruction served to give students basic insights into structure and meaning of English conversation and enhanced interests in studying listening comprehension.

Abstract:   
Differences between learner and teacher beliefs can often lead to a mismatch about what are considered useful classroom language learning activities. This exploratory classroom study stemmed from the author's desire to find out from the students themselves their preferred learning styles, reasons for joining the intensive English language program and, most importantly, to what extent the students felt their English had improved as a result of the course.

Abstract:  
How can English as a Foreign Language (EFL) instructors effectively monitor and assess their students’ spoken second language (L2) production and progress?  By the same token, how can students track their own L2 speaking proficiencies as well as progress?  Pair Taping (PT) is one such method. The author takes a critical look at the literature relating to PT and EFL learner confidence, and applies them to his use of PT.  The author’s qualitative and quantitative research suggests that PT is an affective method in helping students bolster their spoken L2 (English) self-confidence and fluency, providing both student and teacher with valuable insights.

**An Innovative Approach to Developing Learner Potential and Autonomy: Moving from Narrow to Broad Perspectives**

Atsuko Kikuchi

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues//2-3/kikuchi.pdf)

Abstract:   
This paper’s objective is to introduce the strategies employed in the “Narrow to Broad Perspectives (NBP)” approach to second language learning designed by the author to develop autonomous language learning and learner potential. Several stages are incorporated into each lesson to illustrate the interrelatedness and gap between the narrow and broad perspectives. The teaching emphasizes that it is significant to view things from a broadened perspective since broadening our personal dimensions as well as those of others dynamically causes some change in ourselves and the world. The NBP approach may generate positive changes in attitude to learning English and learner potential.

Abstract:  
When working within the confines of the Grammar Translation Method (GTM), it can seem an impossible task to introduce a global issues curriculum.  The author proposes that the goals of an institution (high scores on entrance exams) and the goals of the Global Issues educator need not be in conflict.  This ambitious experiment, conducted over the course of four months at an academic secondary school in Japan, illustrates the importance of preparing young people to be global citizens,  and the flexibility that can be found in a seemingly uncompromising academic environment.

This study’s objective was to assess high school students’ attitudes to studying global issues. Both qualitative and quantitative means were used to accumulate data and responses were tabulated, coded and analyzed.  Results show that the majority of students think learning about global issues is interesting and it makes them more enthusiastic to continue studying English. Although some students said the global issues content was very serious and difficult, many reported that their vision and understanding of the world had deepened. This study’s conclusions indicate that students believe they can simultaneously develop their English language skills while studying global issues.

[View Article](http://www.issues.accentsasia.org/issues/1-1/kurihara.pdf)

Abstract:  
In spite of the government’s emphasis on the acquisition of practical English communication skills in upper secondary education, students’ reluctance to speak English in the classroom remains problematic in Japanese senior high schools. This paper explores how student attitudes might change in the classroom. After examining student expectations and goals in an English oral communication class, experiments were made to find how students might react to the new instruction style, including group work and presentation. Student attitudes changed depending on the instruction styles as well as on the system of their own choice of materials. Peer relationships also affected student attitudes. The teacher’s attempt to provide a comfortable environment in the classroom was the key to changing student attitudes.
